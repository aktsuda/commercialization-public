# Maps for phones shipped in China

Microsoft recommends using the [ChinaVariantWin10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/wcd/wcd-maps#chinavariantwin10) setting instead of this legacy MCSF setting.

For a Windows mobile device shipping in China, partners must specify that the device is intended for that market by configuring `ChinaVariant` setting. When enabled, maps approved by the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping in China are used and the maps are obtained from a server located in China.

This customization may result in different maps, servers, or other configuration changes on the device.

> [!Note]
> If partners do not set the `ChinaVariant` setting to 1, partners may not ship the device in China.
