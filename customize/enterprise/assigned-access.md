# Assigned access

You can use assigned access to set up single-function devices, such as restaurant menus or displays at trade shows. If an account is configured for assigned access, a Windows app of your choosing runs above the lockscreen for the selected user account. Users of that account cannot access any other functionality on the device.

In addition to configuring assigned access, you can also configure optional features to further personalize the assigned access experience. Some of the optional features include power button availability and welcome screen elements.

## Requirements
Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 Education, or Windows 10 Pro.

## Suggested settings

For the most secure assigned access experience, we recommend that you configure the settings as defined in [Complementary settings for assigned access](create-a-kiosk-image.md#assigned-access) and [Other settings to lock down](create-a-kiosk-image.md#lockdown-settings).

## Interactions and interoperability

The following table describes some features that have interoperability issues we recommend that you consider when running assigned access.

> [!Note]
> Where applicable, the table notes which features are optional that you can configure for assigned access.
