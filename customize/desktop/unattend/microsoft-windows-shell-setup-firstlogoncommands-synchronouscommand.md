# SynchronousCommand

`SynchronousCommand` specifies a single command to run the first time a user logs on to the computer. `FirstLogonCommands` are run after logon but before the user sees the desktop.

If you create a user account that does not include administrative privileges, the following commands may not run:

* If User Account Control is enabled, then when that user logs in for the first time, a dialog box appears, prompting the user with an option to allow an administrator to apply the commands. If the user selects **Cancel**, these commands don’t run.
* If User Account Control is disabled, these commands don’t run.

When you add a script using FirstLogonCommands, it will be triggered on the next boot, even if you boot into audit mode using Ctrl+Shift+F3. If you plan to use audit mode later, add the following setting to skip this script automatically: Microsoft-Windows-Deployment\\Reseal\\[Mode](microsoft-windows-deployment-reseal-mode.md) = Audit.

> [!Note]
> This command now works like [Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup-LogonCommands-AsynchronousCommand](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-logoncommands.md). That is, all commands using these unattend settings are now started at the same time, and no longer wait for the previous command to finish.
