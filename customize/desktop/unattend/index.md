# Unattended Windows Setup Reference

The Windows Unattended Setup Reference provides a complete listing of all the settings that you can use to automate the configuration and the deployment of Windows 10.

The Windows Unattended Setup Reference is organized by Windows components and Windows packages, in the same order that the Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM) tool displays each Windows component and package.

Each Windows component includes settings that can be used to create an unattended-installation answer file. Each setting in a component is listed in its own individual topic. If an element contains a value, valid value types are described and XML examples are given.

Information about how to use Windows SIM is available in the [Windows System Image Manager Technical Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/wsim/windows-system-image-manager-technical-reference).

> [!Note]
> All Unattend settings for Windows 10 are also supported in Windows 10 S, with the exception of [Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup-FirstLogonCommands](microsoft-windows-shell-setup-firstlogoncommands.md).
