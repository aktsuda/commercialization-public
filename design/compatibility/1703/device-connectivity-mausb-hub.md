In the current stack, a number of invalid port status bit combinations that the hub reports are ignored. Any invalid combination of port status bits will be treated as an error. In particular, checks will follow these actions:

-   Resetting a port

-   Suspending and resuming a port

-   System resume

A Integrated USB 3.1 Hub should not report spurious change interrupts.
