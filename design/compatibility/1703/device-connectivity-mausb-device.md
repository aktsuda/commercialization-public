## Device.Connectivity.MAUSB.Device 

The following requirements apply to MA-USB Devices.

MA-USB requirements are currently optional and will not be enforced until 2017.

Following table of definitions are used in the context of MA-USB Hub and MA-USB Device requirements:

MA-USB Device PAL:

MA-USB Device PAL, as defined in the MA-USB Specification, is the component of a MA-USB Device or MA-USB Hub that manages the transport of USB payload over the MA link interface.

Integrated USB Device behind a MA-USB Device:

This refers to the USB device logic block in a MA-USB Device that performs USB device functions, as defined by the USB 2.0 or USB 3.1 specification, except those that involve the physical USB medium. For brevity, an Integrated USB Device behind a MA-USB Device will be referred to as Integrated USB Device,

Integrated USB 2.0 Hub behind a MA-USB Hub:

This refers to the USB hub logic block in a MA-USB Hub that performs USB device functions as defined by the USB 2.0 specification, except those upstream port requirements that involve the physical USB medium. For brevity, an Integrated USB 2.0 Hub behind a MA-USB Hub will be referred to as Integrated USB 2.0 Hub,

Integrated USB 3.1 Hub behind a MA-USB Hub:

This refers to the USB hub logic block in a MA-USB Hub that performs USB device functions as defined by the USB 3.1 specification, except those upstream port requirements that involve the physical USB medium. For brevity, an Integrated USB 3.1 Hub behind a MA-USB Hub will be referred to as Integrated USB 3.1 Hub,

Note that Integrated USB Devices behind a USB 2.0 or USB 3.1 hub behind a MA-USB Hub are required to meet Wired USB Device Requirements listed under Device.Connectivity.UsbDevices category.

### Device.Connectivity.MAUSB.Device.BulkOutBufferSize

**Description**

MA-USB requirements are currently optional and will not be enforced until 2017.

Any function of the integrated 3.1 device that is in a suspend state before a MA-USB device is suspended remains in the function suspend state when the MA-USB device is resumed from the suspended state. Any function of the integrated 3.1 device that is in a suspend state before the integrated device is suspended remains in the function suspend state when the integrated device is resumed from the suspended state. Integrated USB devices that are resumed from the suspended state retain a minimum set of device state information as specified in section 9.2.5.2 of the USB 3.0 Specification. Integrated USB device that is in a suspended stare before a MA-USB device is suspended remains in the suspended state when the MA-USB device is resumed from the suspended state.

**Description**

MA-USB requirements are currently optional and will not be enforced until 2017.

-   **Integrated ISO USB device and driver provide multiple alternate settings to support maximum flexibility of hardware interface options:**

    -   If any alternate setting consumes isochronous bandwidth, devices and drivers must provide multiple alternate settings for each interface.

-   **Integrated USB device and driver do not use isochronous bandwidth for alternate setting 0:**

    -   Integraetd USB Devices and drivers must not use isochronous bandwidth for alternate setting 0. Devices must consume bandwidth only when they are in use.

-   **Integrated USB isochronous full-speed or high-speed device that uses more than 50 percent of USB bus bandwidth provides alternate settings:**

    -   If an Integrated USB isochronous full-speed or high-speed device uses more than 50 percent of USB bus bandwidth, it must provide alternative settings that allow the device to switch to a setting that uses less than 50 percent of the bus bandwidth and operate as a device of that particular class (ex. if it is a camera then it must continue to stream video), even though it may be in a lower quality mode.
        Integrated USB Devices with attached host controllers are exempt from this requirement.

-   **Integrated USB device with interfaces containing isochronous endpoints has at least one alternative interface for low bandwidth scenarios:**

    -   Integrated USB device must provide at least one alternative interface for low bandwidth as described in USB Specification, Revision 2.0 or later, Section 9.6.5.

*Design Notes*

See section 9.6.5 in the Universal Serial Bus Specification, Revision 2.0.
If two or more devices are connected that use more than 50 percent of the bus bandwidth and do not provide alternate settings, only one of the devices works at a time.
See USB Specification, Revision 2.0 or later, Sections 5.6 and 5.7.

**Description**

MA-USB requirements are currently optional and will not be enforced until 2017.

Class USB is often used incorrectly for devices that do not have a predefined class. For example, a USB mouse uses class HID, whereas a USB smartcard uses class smartcard reader. Class USB is reserved for host controllers and root or external USB hubs. If the vendor has a device that has no Windows-defined class but uses USB as the bus, it must define its own class or class GUID. The setup class associated with the type of USB device, not with the bus type, must be used. The setup class "USB" (ClassGuid = {36fc9e60-c465-11cf-8056-444553540000}) is reserved for USB host controllers (including MA-USB host PAL) and root or external USB hubs. It must not be used for other device categories.

 
*Design Notes*

Microsoft provides system-defined setup classes for most device types. System-defined setup class GUIDs are defined in the Windows Driver Kit, "Devguid.h."
If you choose the wrong class, the device appears in an incorrect location in Device Manager and in the Windows Vista UI. Using this class incorrectly may cause the device driver to fail hardware compatibility testing.
For a list of Windows class GUIDs, see the Windows Driver Kit, "System-Supplied Device Setup Classes" at: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff553419.aspx>.
