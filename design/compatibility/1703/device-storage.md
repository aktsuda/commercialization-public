## Device.Storage.Controller

*General feature that applies to all storage controllers*

> [!WARNING]
> Certification for Windows Server 2016, Azure Stack, and SDDC must continue to meet the Windows Hardware Compatibility Requirements as stated in version 1607 of documentation, must use [version 1607 of the HLK (build 14393)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=404112) with [matching playlist](http://aka.ms/hlkplaylist) and supplemental content to generate logs, and must follow policies as stated in the [Windows Server Policy document](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834831). Questions about the Azure Stack or SDDC programs or how to submit the results for solution validation should be directed to the appropriate Microsoft technical account manager or partner management contact.

<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Controller Basic Functionality

PCI-based host controllers and adapters must support PCI bus mastering as the default setting, and virtual direct access memory (DMA) services must be supported in the host adapter option ROM.

Devices that cannot perform their function without other registry modifications, other than those performed automatically by the device class co-installer, are not eligible for the certification.

All commands must be passed to the underlying physical device unless the controller is a RAID adapter.

If a device returns less data than requested, it must correctly indicate an underrun condition and adapters must handle this in accordance with the WDK (adjust DataTransferLength).

Non-RAID Controller

Miniport drivers other than RAID drivers may not create pseudo devices to be used as targets for management commands for the adapter when no actual LUNs are present. Instead, a SCSI miniports INF must specify the CreateInitiatorLu parameter under the services Parameters key and set this DWORD value to 1. This may not be done using a coinstaller. Storage miniport drivers do not use this parameter as the adapter may always be used even if no devices are present. Values for storage drivers are documented in the WDK.

The following Storage Controller Driver Logo requirement is for the storage controller driver that does not have a matched submission category in the current Windows Hardware Certification Program. Any storage controller with a matched submission category shall be submitted under its matched category.

-   Storage controller driver must be a STORPORT MINIPORT driver.

-   Registry Entries for STORPORT Miniport Drivers - STORAGE\_BUS\_TYPE must set to BusTypeUnknown (0x00).

-   For storage controllers, the controller itself must correctly translate the commands and respond in accordance with the applicable SCSI specifications, even if the controller implements other command protocols on a different interface type such as SATA, NVMe, or PQI. Any commands that are not recognized must result in a SCSI check condition with valid sense data.

### Device.Storage.Controller.ClassCode

*Bus-attached controllers must implement the correct class/subclass code as defined in the PCI Code and ID Assignment Specification (Rev. 1.6).*

<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Controller Class Code

Storage host controllers and adapters must meet the requirements for the device protocol used and any requirements related to the device storage bus.
Bus-attached controllers must implement the correct class/subclass code as specified in PCI 2.3, Appendix D. This applies to all bus types including, but not limited to, IDE, Fibre Channel, SCSI, and SATA-based devices. Any device that implements RAID functionality regardless of whether the RAID implementation is done in hardware, firmware, or in the driver code, must implement the PCI RAID Class Code (01/04) and not use the interconnect class code (for example, a SATA RAID controller must implement the 01/04 class code and not the AHCI class code 01/06/01).

Non-PCI attached storage host controller does not need to report PCI class code. However, it must report the equivalent ACPI Compatibility ID.

### Device.Storage.Controller.InfFile

*All host adapters must be installed by using Plug and Play mechanisms and require the use of an INF file.*

<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Controller INF File
All host adapters must be installed by using Plug and Play mechanisms and require the use of an INF. Installation programs must use INF files, must pass the most current Chkinf tool, and can explicitly modify the registry values only by using INF file constructs that meet the Windows certification program requirements. Changes can be made only under the following keys:

-   TimeoutValues under the class driver services keys (Disk and Tape).

-   SpecialTargetList only for SCSIport implementations.

-   Device's service key (must be HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ and the Parameters\\Device subkey under that).

-   Signal BusChangeDetected on any link transition or detection of a hot-plug event. A limited settling is allowed before this is signaled, but it must be settable through a registry parameter.

-   Implementation of the BusType registry DWORD to correctly set the interface type in accordance with the enumeration in NTDDSTOR.H (see the WDK). This value must be set in the miniport's INF under the service's Parameters key. There is no programmatic way to set it and you may not rely on coinstallers as they do not run under all scenarios.

<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Miniport Driver Model

Drivers used with storage controllers must follow the miniport driver model. Storage Miniports must comply with all miniport interface definitions as defined in the WDK. Fibre Channel, iSCSI, SAS, SAS RAID SATA, SATA RAID, SCSI, and SCSI RAID controller drivers must be STORPORT miniports. Monolithic, full-port drivers or other types of drivers that do not follow the miniport model are not eligible for the certification. All drivers for physical hardware must be implemented to support Plug and Play. Legacy drivers are no longer supported.

Any device that depends on a filter driver for physical disk drive functionality is not eligible for certification. Filter drivers may not be used to bypass any part of the storage stack. For example, a filter driver many not directly access any hardware (such as by using HAL calls) and filter drivers may not be used to link cache manager to the hardware implementation. Filter drivers may not be used to violate any terms of the certification program.

Multipathing drivers may not be tied to specific HBAs except for PCI RAID controllers and must use the MPIO model.

Transient or pseudo-devices may not be exposed to the system. Drivers that specify NODRV may be used to "claim" management devices that report as processor, controller, or MSC device types. Such drivers that do not refer to a service entry are not eligible for the certification, but they can be signed.

**Description**

PATA Interface
PATA controllers must comply with the ATA/ATAPI-7 specification. Bus-mastering DMA capability is required for all PATA controllers with the exception of compact flash and similar flash-RAM device.
The following requirements are also applied to ATA/ATAPI controllers.

-   The PACKET command protocol as defined in ATA/ATAPI-7 Volume 2, Section 11.8, must notÂ be implemented in ATA-only controllers.

-   PATA controllers that support the PACKET command protocol must be fully implemented as defined in ATA/ATAPI-7 Volume 2, Section 11.8.

-   Identify Device data fields (61:60) and (103:100) must not be used to determine 28-bit or 48-bit LBA addressing support. Instead, bit 10 of word 83 and bit 10 of word 86 must be checked for 48-bit LBA addressing support as defined in ATA/ATAPI-7, Volume 1, Section 4.2.1.

### Device.Storage.Controller.AzureStack.CloudStress
*Storage controllers that are used to connect to cluster storage for the private cloud solution must comply with this specification* 

<table><tr><th>Applies to</th><td><p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p></td></tr></table>

**Description**

Private cloud solutions comprise of tightly integrated software and hardware components to deliver resiliency with high performance. Issues in any of the components (software, hardware, drivers, firmware, and so forth) can compromise the solution and undermine any promises made regarding the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the private cloud. 

Many of these issues are surfaced only under a high-stress, private cloud simulation. The Private Cloud Simulator (PCS) enables you to validate your component in a cloud scenario and identify such issues. It simulates a live datacenter/private cloud by creating VM workloads, scheduling administrative operations (load balancing, software/hardware maintenance), and injecting faults (unplanned hardware/software failures) on the private cloud. 

To comply with this specification, the controller must pass the PCS test run with the âStorage Controller â Azure Stackâ profile on a 4-node clustered configuration.

### Device.Storage.Controller.AzureStack.FirmwareUpdate
*Storage controllers that are used to connect to cluster storage for the private cloud solution must comply with this specification*

<table><tr><th>Applies to</th><td><p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p></td></tr></table>

**Description**

Microsoft Azure Stack will require SAS and NVMe controllers to be firmware updateable. For NVMe controllers, this must be possible through the inbox [firmware update mechanism](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2016/01/25/updating-firmware-for-disk-drives-in-windows-server-2016-tp4/) introduced in WS 2016 (Update-StorageFirmware). Also, SAS HBAs must properly translate firmware download and activate commands according to the [SAT-4](http://www.t10.org/cgi-bin/ac.pl?t=f&f=sat4r04a.pdf) specification.

**Description**

Controller Boot Support

Option ROMs in host controllers and adapters for any interface type, including RAID controllers, that provide boot support must fully support extended Int13h functions (functions 4xh) as defined in BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive Services - 3 \[T13-D1572\], Revision 3 or later. Logical block addressing is the only addressing mechanism supported.

It is recommended that controllers also support booting using the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) and implement device paths as defined in EDD-3. Starting from Windows 8, it is required for controllers to support booting using the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI).

SD/eMMC/NAND flash controllers do not have Option ROM, so the first part of this requirement does not apply. EFI support is required.

### Device.Storage.Controller.Boot.BitLocker

**Description**

BitLocker must be properly enabled to protect an operating system in a SAN Boot configuration.

**Business Justification**

(1) When a server is placed in an environment without adequate physical security, BitLocker protects data on the server against unauthorized access if a server is stolen; (2) When hosting service providers repurpose or decommission storage arrays, BitLocker Disk Encryption prevents data breach.

Fibre Channel Interface
Fibre Channel host bus adapter drivers must support the WMI classes and methods required to implement the FC-HBA or SM-API by using the Microsoft HBAAPI.DLL. Vendors may not replace the Microsoft-provided version of the HBAAPI.DLL file. A subset of Hbapiwmi.mof WMI classes and methods are required for Windows compatibility. Other WMI classes are optional and are grouped to form feature sets. If a driver implements any part of an optional feature set, all related classes in that feature set must be supported. In some cases, some features are grouped into subfeatures. If a driver implements such a subfeature, the driver must correctly support that specific subfeature.

-   Device logons must be consistent with the Microsoft iSCSI Discovery Service.

-   Any boot device configured by other means must be reported to the service after boot.

-   Any other persistent target assignments and sessions under control of the HBA must be reported by using WMI to the iSCSI Initiator Service when it is available.

-   The following logon authentication implementations are both required:

	<!-- -->

	-   "CHAP-target authenticates initiator"

	-   None

	<!-- -->

-   Mutual CHAP, if implemented, must adhere to the specification and will be tested.

-   IPSec support must adhere to all applicable IPSec requirements in this document.

-   The HBA driver must implement all required WMI interfaces documented in the WDK.

-   The initiator must perform an automatic logon to targets assigned to the computer as persistent targets. The initiator will connect to all persistent targets before the targets are enumerated by Windows, which starts with an Inquiry to LUN 0. If a connection drops, it will continue to try to reconnect. Devices cannot depend on the discovery service for this information.

-   Initiators must:

	<!-- -->

	-   Maintain the persistent logon information in the registry or in NVRAM.

	-   Support the new WMI class for defining/managing persistent logons.

	-   Persist IP network adapter and discovery configurations (IP configuration information, such as static IP address, static default gateway IP address, static subnet mask, and DNS server) or use DHCP to obtain this information.

	-   For discovery configuration, remember which discovery methods are used and, for iSNS (if implemented), maintain the address of the iSNS server.

	<!-- -->

-   An iSCSI HBA must support changers, disk, tape, and external RAID devices.

RAID Controller

-   Miniport drivers for PCI RAID adapters may create a management LU if this device is always available for management commands and has a device type other than disk. Since this device will appear in device manager, a NODRV INF may be submitted to claim this device and prevent user popups (this INF may be signed).

-   For RAID controllers, the controller itself must correctly interpret the commands and respond in accordance with the applicable SCSI specifications, even if the controller implements RAID on a different interface type such as SATA. Any commands that are not recognized must result in a SCSI check condition with valid sense data.

-   (If Implemented) If the RAID controller supports a disk pass-through mode (aka HBA mode) and the use of SATA drives, it should implement at least the following T10 SAT-4 spec (Rev. 03a) translations:

	-   Download Microcode mode 0Eh (Section 8.16.2.5)

	-   Download Microcode mode 0Fh (Section 8.16.2.6)

    Note: Compliance with this requirement should be tested by connecting a SATA drive, compliant with the Windows 10 firmware update requirements, to the Raid controller in HBA mode and running the HLK Firmware Update Test.

SCSI Requirements can be found in the Device.Storage.SCSI section.

**Description**

When the device and driver are configured in multiple nodes in a Windows failover cluster, each node must support as a minimum âdual-activeâ access, defined as full read/write functionality for at least one LUN that has the capability to be failed over to another node in the cluster. Specifically, a device is not allowed to only support passive operation where the device and driver operate only in the standby mode until the cluster fails over a LUN from another node.

Design Notes:

-   For this âdual-activeâ access, LUNs do not need to provide full, performant read/write functionality to all nodes in the cluster. Access from other nodes only needs to be supported as required to support a valid Windows failover cluster.

-   Specifically, it is desirable but not required to support simultaneous, shared access to a LUN from multiple nodes in the cluster.

-   A device must comply with Reservation behavior as defined in SPC-3 section 5.6

-   Specifically, SCSI compliance testing should take special care to verify the following:

    -   Verify Reserving â once reserved, the scope & type of an existing persistent reservation cannot be changed

    -   Comply with section 5.6.1 â table 32

    -   Comply with section 5.6.6 â table 33, table 34, table 36 â verify Good Status conditions

    -   Verify, re-register an I\_T nexus that has already been registered (5.6.6) â should return good status

    -   Verify, re-reserve an I\_T nexus that holds the persistent reservation (5.6.9) â should return good status

    -   Return Reservation conflict â if PRO command with service action PREEMPT or PREEMPT & ABORT is sent with invalid Service Action Reservation Key (5.6.10.4.4)

    -   Verify Additional Length Field per 6.11.3.2 - should return zero when no persistent reservation is held

Design Notes:

-   It is recommended that in addition to the standard HCT qualification, all solutions are also validated with the "Microsoft Cluster Configuration Validation Wizard" (ClusPrep) tool.

-   Only SAS devices using the Serial SCSI Protocol (SSP) transport will be supported on failover clusters (including SAS JBOD or any SAS SSP RAID systems).

If the system disks are attached to a bus type that is not a valid type for shared storage (something other than FC, iSCSI, or SAS), then the system disks and shared.

**Description**

When a node in a Windows Failover Cluster fails over its resources, either planned or unplanned (e.g., resulting from a node crash or node power failure), the device and driver must meet the following requirements:

-   All data from successfully acknowledged writes prior to failover must be preserved and accessible from surviving nodes. Specifically, data corresponding to write operations sent to the device and driver on the failing node prior to the start of failover of its LUNs (i.e., after the corresponding RAID controller on a surviving node receives a persistent reservation request corresponding to the LUNs from the failed node) that have been acknowledged by the driver as completed must be accessible after failover completes from a surviving node. In addition, any data that may be pending from unacknowledged writes at the start of failover must not change data subsequently written to the device from a surviving node.

-   When the LUNs supported by the RAID controller on the failing node stop being accessible (i.e., stop acknowledging and processing I/O requests), the LUN must be made accessible (i.e., acknowledge and process I/O requests) by at least one other node in the cluster with a maximum delay of 5 seconds. This time limit must be supported for up to 100 LUNs or the maximum number of LUNs supported by the controller, whichever is smaller.

During normal operation (i.e., not during failover) in a Windows failover cluster, the device and driver must meet the following requirement:

-   All I/O requests to any LUN supported by the RAID controller must complete within 25 seconds. This time limit must be supported for up to 100 LUNs or the maximum number of LUNs supported by the controller, whichever is smaller.

**Description**

-   A device and its driver must support commands from SBC-2 (or later) regardless of the drive interface implemented.

-   A device and its driver must support, at a minimum, one of: RAID1, RAID 5, RAID6 or RAID 1/0, or an equivalent feature that supports full LUN functionality in the event of failure of a single data drive.

-   A device and its driver RAID implementation must provide a solution to prevent data loss due to the RAID âwrite holeâ failure mechanism. (See Design Notes for definition of the RAID âwrite holeâ failure mechanism.)

**Design Notes**

If there is a system or controller failure during active writes, the erasure code information of a stripe (e.g., parity) may become inconsistent with the data. Data loss may result if this incorrect erasure code information is subsequently used to reconstruct the missing block in that stripe. This problem is known as the RAID âwrite holeâ.

-   Examples of typical solutions for the RAID write hole problem are to provide mechanisms to detect and recover from an interrupted update-in-place operation or to avoid update-in-place semantics.

**Description**

The following requirements must be fulfilled by the NVMe device in general:

-   The device must support PCIe Gen2 or higher.

The device must support the following interrupt modes:


-   Running with the requested number of interrupts (i.e., &gt; 1 MSI or MSI-X based interrupt)

-   Running with only 1 MSI or MSI-X interrupt

-   Running with only 1 line-based interrupt

    -   \[Server\] MSI-X is required

    -   \[Client\] MSI or MSI-X is required

The device must use the following class and sub-class codes for identification, for further driver matching the vendor and product IDs should be utilized:

-   Base Class:01h

-   Sub-Class:08h

-   Programming Interface:02h

The device must have at least one upgradeable firmware slot.

\[Client\] (If Implemented) The device shall support either:

-   A non-operational NVMe power state with a maximum listed power consumption of no more than 5mW and an exit latency to an operational state of less than 100ms (implies L1.2), or

-   The ability to resume from D3cold (power-off) within 500ms, while not exceeding an entry latency of 1,000ms.

Note: If such a power state or capability is not provided by the device, experience on Connected Standby systems will be affected negatively as battery drain increases significantly.

It is highly recommended that NVMe devices that are to be used in client systems with limited cooling capability support at least the following in addition to 100% on and off states:

-   1 operational power state (reduced performance) â such that significant thermal throttling of the device is possible

-   1 non-operational power state with a resume latency of at most 50ms.

The device must provide physical-location-independent identification information: **(This will be required after September 1, 2017)**

-   NVMe devices must use a unique value in the Serial Number field contained within the Identify Controller Data Structure, as described in the NVM Express 1.1b specification
    - The Serial Number field must match the serial number physically printed on a field-replaceable drive.


The following requirements that the device must fulfill are specific to revision 1.0 of the official NVMe spec:

-   3.1.1 Controller Capabilities

    -   MPSMIN (Memory Page Size Minimum) must be set to 0. Bit: 51:48

-   5.2 Asynchronous Event Request

    -   Error events, as well as SMART / Health status events must be supported, see section 5.12 below.

-   5.3 Create I/O Completion Queue

-   5.4 Create I/O Submission Queue

-   5.5 Delete I/O Completion Queue

-   5.6 Delete I/O Submission Queue

-   At least 2 queues must be supported for 5.3 through 5.6

    -   1 set of I/O submission and completion queues and 1 set of admin submission and completion queues are acceptable.

    -   Note: It is recommended to provide at least 4 I/O queues on client devices and 16 or more on server devices to provide the ability to bind one set of queues per processor on the system.

-   5.7 Firmware Commit

    -   Activation of a firmware image should be done without requiring a power cycle of the device.

    -   The activation process is expected to be achieved via a host-initiated reset, as described in section 8.1 of spec version 1.2a.
    
        - ï§	Windows will utilize commit actions 001b or 010b when issuing a firmware commit command.
        
ï§	   -    Expected completion values for successful activation without a power cycle are 00h (generic success), 10h, or 11h.

ï§	   -    If 0Bh is returned as completion status, Windows will inform the user to perform a power cycle of the device. This is highly discouraged, as it prevents updating of firmware at OS runtime and causes significant workload disruption.

    -   The device must implement and populate at least the log pages for Error Information (01h), SMART / Health Information (02h), and Firmware Slot Information (03h)

-   5.11 Identify

    -   MDTS (Maximum Data Transfer Size) must be either 0 (no limitation) or at least 5 (128KB). Byte: 77

        -   Note: This value may increase in future revisions and next generation devices should be designed with this in mind.

    -   NN (Number of Namespaces) must be at least 1. Bytes: 519:516

    -   FLBAS (Formatted LBA Size) must have bit 4 set to 0. Byte: 26

        -   If the Metadata Capabilities feature is supported, this requirement holds, otherwise it can be ignored; i.e., iff MC bit 1 is set to 1, the above FLBAS requirement is binding. Byte: 27

    -   LBADS (LBA Data Size) must be set to 9 or 12, i.e., 512B or 4KB. Bits: 23:16

        -   Other LBA data sizes are acceptable, as long as 512B or 4KB is supported.

    -   At least NGUID (Namespace Globally Unique Identifier) or EUI64 must be implemented.

    -   Interrupt Coalescing (08h)

    -   Asynchronous Event Configuration (0Bh)

-   5.13 (If Implemented) Format NVM

    -   The device should be capable to perform a Cryptographic Erase (SES Value 010b)

        -   If cryptographic erase is not supported, Windows will not utilize the FormatNVM command.

    -   Format NVM must be targetable at individual namespaces, i.e., Bit 1 and Bit 0 in the Identify Controller data structure, of Byte 524 (FNA), must be set to 0.

-   6.6 Dataset Management â Deallocate

    -   All I/O and Deallocate commands shall be completed in less than 500 ms.

<table><tr><th>Applies to</th><td><p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p></td></tr></table>

**Description**

Private cloud solutions comprise of tightly integrated software and hardware components to deliver resiliency with high performance. Issues in any of the components (software, hardware, drivers, firmware, and so forth) can compromise the solution and undermine any promises made regarding the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the private cloud.

Many of these issues are surfaced only under a high-stress, private cloud simulation. The Private Cloud Simulator (PCS) enables you to validate your component in a cloud scenario and identify such issues. It simulates a live datacenter/private cloud by creating VM workloads, scheduling administrative operations (load balancing, software/hardware maintenance), and injecting faults (unplanned hardware/software failures) on the private cloud.

To comply with this specification, the controller must pass the PCS test run with the Storage Enclosure profile on a 4-node clustered configuration.

**Description**

**Following applies to ATA based Hard Disk Drives:**

If implemented, support for storage devices withÂ logical sector sizes larger than 512-bytesÂ need to be implemented as described in the ATA-8 specifications. Please refer to the INCITS T13 specification repository for access to the specification.

**Following applies to SCSI based Hard Disk Drives:**

If implemented, support for storage devices with logical sector sizesÂ larger than 512-bytes need to be implemented as described in the SBC-3, SPC-4, and SAT-3 specifications. Please refer to the INCITS T10 specification repository for access to the relevant specifications.
Â 
**Business Justification**

Some hard disk drivesÂ report the physical sector size of the disk incorrectly. For example, the drive is released a "4K" drive without reporting that it is indeed a 4K drive.Â Applications use the reported physical sector size as a notion of atomicity and perform I/O based on this. The most basic example is a database-style application will only store one commit record within the unit of atomic write for fear of loss if power is lost or if a physical sector becomes physically bad. When the reported physical sector size is not the unit of atomicity, serious reliability concerns can arise in scenarios where power is lost such as: Applications can fail to recover, and users will need to restore from backup. Applications can fail to recover, but the application will need to perform a lengthy consistency check. Corruption of metadata, log file data, user data, or even data from other applications.

Recommended:

Reporting Nominal Media Rotation Rate

If a device requires Windows defragmentation to be turned off by default, the device should report its Nominal Media Rotation Rate as 0001h Non-rotating media (e.g., solid state device) as per the ATA8-ACS1 specification, section 7.16.7.77.Â 

Justification:

When the Nominal Media Rotation Rate reported by the device is anything but 0001h Non-rotating media, Windows will by default perform defragmentation of the block storage device.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Applies to</th>
<td>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Multi-port drives must support the same set of commands on all ports.Â  Drives must not provide different behavior or degraded performance for commands based on which port is used for command delivery.

When drives are connected to a host via multiple paths, the drives must use Windows' Multipath IO (MPIO) solution with the Microsoft Device Specific Module (DSM).

Example:Â  Drives must provide the same performance for data access commands and the same behavior for persistent reservation commands arriving on different ports as they provide when those commands arrive on the same port.

The performance degradation between any two ports should be within a 10% range.

Notes:Â  Multi-port drives may be connected to one or more computer hosts via one or more paths per host.Â  Connecting a drive to multiple hosts enables Windows to use the drive as part of a failover cluster of hosts.Â  Connecting a drive to a single host via multiple paths enables Windows to continue to provide access to the drive in the event of a cable failure.Â  Windows supports using these connection topologies independently and jointly.

**Description**

**Required**: All Microsoft MPIO device-specific modules (DSMs) must be Windows Hardware Certification-qualified and support registering and unregistering persistent reservations across all paths.

Design Notes:

-   All host bus adaptors (HBA) used on failover cluster nodes can use only a Windows Hardware Certification-qualified miniport driver based on the Storport miniport model.

-   All multipath I/O solutions leveraged on highly available failover clusters must be based on Microsoft MPIO.

-   It is recommended that in addition to the standard HCT qualification all solutions are also validated with the "Microsoft Cluster Configuration Validation Wizard" (ClusPrep) tool.

-   FC, iSCSI, and particularly serial-attached SCSI (SAS) failover cluster solutions cannot be built on RAID HBAs where cache and/or RAID configuration is machine/node specific. The RAID set information and hardware cache must reside in a single shared point that lives in an external storage controller.

-   SAS, FC, and iSCSI have no restrictions as to the number of nodes they support (which currently is 8nodes).

Note: Legacy parallel-SCSI server clusters were restricted to a maximum size of 2 nodes.

-   Only SAS devices using the Serial SCSI Protocol (SSP) transport will be supported on failover clusters (including SAS JBOD or any SAS SSP RAID systems). SATA devices attached to a SAS domain must be part of a RAID system.

-   SATA direct attach and SATA JBOD is not supported; the system must include RAID.

-   If the system disks are attached to a bus type that is not a valid type for shared storage (something other then FC, iSCSI, or SAS), then the system disks and shared storage must be on separate physical controllers/host bus adaptors.

RAID Requirements

RAID systems and devices must support commands from SBC-2 (or later) regardless of the drive interface implemented.

RAID controllers and RAID systems must support, at a minimum, one of: RAID1, RAID 5, RAID6, or RAID 1/0.

External RAID arrays must allow a failed drive that is redundant to be replaced manually without shutting down or halting the system. This requirement includes, but is not limited to, drives in a mirror set, a physical drive being replaced by a "hot spare," and the first failed drive in a RAID level-5 array. The RAID subsystem must also allow lost data to be rebuilt without interfering with system operations. It is expected that RAID array throughput will be impacted during the rebuild.

**Description**

The following functionalities and requirements have to be supported by the device and refer to hybrid devices in general. They are required for use with the Windows in-box driver (StorAHCI.sys).

If a drive reports itself as a hybrid drive, it must be comprised of a spinning disk and at least one non-volatile cache (NVC) component within a single physical device.

Self-Pinning on Boot

The device shall implement a mechanism to self-pin boot files, i.e., anything prior to Windows becoming active, into the top priority level of the cache. Specifically, the drive shall self-pin in this fashion from power on until the Hybrid Information Log Page is read. The drive should cease self-pinning to the top priority after 160 MB of data has been pinned. All other self-pinning the drive performs shall occur at priority 0.

Cache Size

The hybrid cache has to provide at least 5 GB (5x2<sup>30</sup> Bytes) of useable capacity to the host.

Note: Devices providing less than 12 GB of useable cache capacity will not be eligible to benefit from hiberfile, swapfile, or other sequential I/O caching.

6 priority levels (0 through 5)

The device must support at least 6 priority levels. No data placed in the cache by the host shall be evicted from ranges 1 through 5 by the device, unless Windows specifies it through calls to evict, demotebysize or trim, or issues further I/Os with priority &gt; 0 to a full cache (i.e., cache churning).

Priority 0

Any I/O hinted at priority 0 shall be serviced directly by the platter, regardless of current state (i.e., if the platter is spun down and receives a priority 0 I/O, it shall spin-up). I/O hinted at priority 0 shall bypass the non-volatile cache and invalidate any cache-resident LBAs that are hinted at priority 0 and now present on platter.

Direct Flash Access

When the platter is spun down, all hinted write commands â except priority 0 writes â shall be serviced directly by the non-volatile cache. The write I/O shall not be staged on the platter first, so as to avoid platter spin-up. If the write cannot be serviced by the non-volatile cache, due to resource constraints (no clean pages, etc.) the platter may spin-up to service the I/O.

Power Up In Standby

The device must support the Power Up In Standby feature (PUIS) defined in SATA spec ATA ACS-3.

Cache Page Replacement

The drive shall repurpose cache pages of lower priorities to satisfy I/Os at higher priorities, starting with the lowest priority. For example, if the cache is full with 25% at priority 0, 50% at priority 2, and 25% at priority 3 and a priority 3 read/write occurs that is not in cache, a priority 0 cache page should be repurposed to accommodate the priority 3 LBA that was read. Once all priority 0 cache pages are repurposed, priority 1 and 2 pages will be repurposed respectively. If no lower priority pages are available, priority 3 should repurpose pages first that are chosen by a LRU-like algorithm.

Update Priority On IO (Read/Write)

Priorities associated with LBAs in the cache must be updated on any subsequent read or write to that LBA, from any valid priority to any valid priority. In addition, if a read or write is issued to an LBA range that currently does NOT reside in cache, then it shall be placed in the cache at the specified priority (provided there is room in the cache or there are blocks of lower priority that can be evicted â in case of a full cache).

Trim

The device shall support trim as defined in the Windows 8 Hardware Certification Requirements under Device.Storage.Hd.Trim.BasicFunction.

Non-volatile Cache Performance:

Random Read: &gt;= 8 MB/s @ 4 KB (Queue Depth = 1)

Latency:

Setting dirty high and dirty low thresholds shall complete within 50 ms.

This command can be completed asynchronously.

I/O that carries priority information should not be significantly slower than I/O without priority information. A read or write that has a priority assigned must not incur a latency penalty larger than the bigger of 10% of an identical I/O without priority information or 0.5 ms (max(10%,0.5 ms)). Achieving this on 95% of all I/Os is acceptable with the penalty never exceeding 100% of a non-priority I/O.

HybridDemoteBySize must return within 500ms when called on 3/255<sup>th</sup> of the cache size.

HybridChangePriorityByLBARange must return within 150 ms when called on a 32 MB range of data.

A possible asynchronous implementation of these commands is acceptable.

Command/Protocol Requirements

The following functionalities and requirements have to be supported by the device and refer SATA revision 3.2 worked on by SATAIO:

13.7.5.4.11 MaxPriority Behavior

The MaxPriority Behavior bit must be set to 0.

13.3.15 Enable/Disable Hybrid Information

13.6.5.4.13 Hybrid Control

Enable/Disable Caching Medium

Windows must have the ability to enable and disable the hybrid cache. Upon disabling the hybrid cache, all dirty data in the cache has to be synchronized with the final storage medium.

Dirty Low Threshold

Dirty High Threshold

Dirty data should be synchronized in ascending order of priority, i.e., priority 0 dirty data should be synchronized before priority 1 dirty data is synchronized. When the amount of dirty data on the device, exceeds the dirty high threshold marker, the device must begin the synchronization of dirty data. It is understood that this requires the platter to spin-up.

13.6.5.4.7 Hybrid Demote By Size

Hybrid Information feature related Logs

The device must enable Windows to read the hybrid log pages and return sensible information. In other words, General Purpose Logging is required and the version number shall be set to 0001h. Specifically:

13.7.9 Word 0x12 of âGeneral Purpose Log Directoryâ shall be set to â1â, indicating that the âNCQ NON-DATAâ log is supported.

13.7.10 Word 0x13 of âGeneral Purpose Log Directoryâ shall be set to â1â, indicating that the âNCQ SEND AND RECEIVEâ log is supported.

13.7.12 Word 0x14 of âGeneral Purpose Log Directoryâ shall be set to â1â, indicating that the âNCQ HYBRID INFORMATIONâ log is supported. Windows has to be able to determine the following:

Caching Medium Health Status

Dirty Low Threshold

Dirty High Threshold

Maximum Hybrid Priority Level

Max Priority Behavior

NVM size

Max Eviction Commands.

Max Eviction Data Blocks

For each Priority level:

consumed NVM size fraction

consumed Mapping Resources Fraction

consumed NVM Size for Dirty Data Fraction

consumed Mapping Resources for dirty data fraction

13.6.5.4.1 Hybrid Evict

The LBA range specified by the Evict command shall be targeted to the primary medium like a regular write. The host will ensure consistency â if necessary â by issuing a subsequent flush command. Evicted LBA ranges should be invalidated in the NVC, such that the data only resides on the platter after completion of the Evict command.

13.6.5.4.10 Hybrid Change By LBA Range

Hybrid Change By LBA Range must be supported by the device, including the Cache Behavior bit of the command.

SCSI termination built onto internal cables must also meet the SPI-4 specification.

-   Terminator power must be supplied to the SCSI bus with overcurrent protection. The host adapter must supply terminator power (TERMPWR) to the SCSI bus for system-board implementations by using PCI or another expansion bus. All terminators on the external SCSI bus must be powered from the TERMPWR lines in the SCSI bus. In addition, the circuit that supplies TERMPWR must have overcurrent protection built into it.

-   External removable disks, hard drives, and CD/DVD optical drives must provide automatic termination or an accessible on-board termination switch. At a minimum, a mechanical means must be provided for setting termination and the switch must be accessible to the user without opening the device chassis.

-   All SCSI devices supporting hot plugging must comply with annex D of SPI-4, which addresses SCSI device insertion and removal, with and without command activity.

-   Differential devices must support DIFFSENS as defined in SPI-4 standard or later.

-   Following a reset, all devices must return an appropriate unit attention condition to any initiator currently having access to the logical unit.

-   All FC, iSCSI, SCSI, and SAS devices must support multiple initiators.

-   MODE SELECT commands that change parameters must cause a unit attention condition to be raised for any other initiator consistent with SAM-3.

-   LUN 0 must be implemented for all targets. At a minimum, LUN 0 must respond to INQUIRY and all multi-LUN targets must support the REPORT LUNS commands.

-   If any LUN is added or removed that is accessible to the initiator(s), the device must report a unit attention condition of (06/3F/0E) REPORT LUNS DATA HAS CHANGED MODE SELECT. Commands that change parameters must cause a unit attention condition to be raised for any other initiator that would be impacted by the change.

-   Any unrecognized SCSI command or incorrectly formed command descriptor block (CDB) must result in an immediate CHECK CONDITION reported back to the initiator.

**Description**

SCSI Primary Commands-3 (SPC-3), SCSI Primary Commands-4 (SPC-4) and SCSI Block Commands-3 (SBC-3)

Devices must comply with SCSI Primary Commands: support commands listed as mandatory in the SCSI Primary Commands (SPC-3 or later). In addition, each device type must implement the mandatory command set for that type (SBC-3 for block devices and so on).

**For SCSI INQUIRY and REPORT LUNS commands**:

All devices must support the SCSI INQUIRY command.

Multi-LUN devices must always respond to an INQUIRY command sent to LUN 0 even if LUN 0 is not implemented. This can be indicated by returning the Device Type Qualifier of 3.

-   All multi-LUN devices must support the REPORT LUNS command as defined in SPC-2 or later.

-   Windows supports only single-level logical unit numbers up to 255; see SAM-3. Use of any other format will be incorrectly interpreted, and the device may not be available or data corruption will occur.

All standard INQUIRY data must be correctly set for the device capabilities.

-   VERSION Field must be 04 or greater. For SAS, this field must be 05 or greater.

-   Drives with attached media changers must set the MChgnr bit in the standard inquiry data.

-   Multi-LUN units must return valid REPORT LUNS data for LUN 0.

-   If LUN 0 is not an accessible PERIPHERAL DEVICE TYPE, the PERIPHERAL QUALIFIER shall be returned as 1. SCSIport will not enumerate the entire target device if a qualifier of 3 is used. It is strongly recommended that LUN 0 not be type 0 because it must be exposed to all initiators. Type 0 is permitted only if the array can map different logical units to LUN 0 for each initiator.

-   If a device has more than one port, MultiP bit must be set and page 83h descriptors must correctly reflect the port information.

Vital Product Data (VPD) pages:

-   Page 00h (Supported Pages VPD Page) is required.

-   Page B1h (Block Device Characteristics VPD Page) is required.

-   Page 80h (Unit Serial Number VPD Page) is required.

    Page 83h (Device Identification VPD Page) is required. For VPD Page 83, at least one type-3 or one type-2 descriptor must be returned for each logical unit, the value must use Code Set 1 (Binary), the value must be unique for that logical unit, and it must be the same value regardless of the path or port responding to the request. Appropriate descriptors for multiport devices are required in addition to that mandatory descriptor. Devices that support aliases must also support the corresponding descriptor types. Vendor-specific device identifiers, if present, must use type 0 and must follow the specified format, including correct page length.

-   Vendor-specific identifiers are not a substitute for the mandatory type 2/3 descriptors. All device identifiers must conform to formatting rules set forth in SPC-3 or later, even if the device claims only conformance to a previous release.

-   Device must comply with SPC-3 section 7.6.3 Device Identification VPD page 83h.

At least one identification descriptor must have the IDENTIFIER TYPE field set to:

-   2h (EUI-64-based) as defined in 7.6.3.5

-   3h (NAA); or as defined in 7.6.3.6

-   8h (SCSI name string) at defined in 7.6.3.11

**SCSI Mode Sense Command and Pages **

MODE SENSE (6) is mandatory for all devices except RBC devices, which implement MODE SENSE (10). The DBD bit must be supported.

-   Mode Page 3Fh (Return all pages mode page) is mandatory.

-   Device type-specific pages listed in the device-specific sections of this document.

-   Additional commands for all devices are as follows:

-   All devices must support the TEST UNIT READY and REQUEST SENSE commands.

**Block Storage (Disk and RAID) Devices **

Block storage (disk and RAID) devices must comply with the following requirements:

-   SCSI block commands (SBC) or later (RBC for 1394). These requirements apply to any device reporting as Device Type 0, including logical units exposed by a RAID controller or subsystem.

-   Block Devices must support the SCSI START STOP UNIT command to decrease power consumption.

-   READ CAPACITY (10) command. If a device has more than 2^32 - 1 sectors, a value of 0xFFFFFFFF must be returned for the RETURNED LOGICAL BLOCK ADDRESS field and the READ CAPACITY (16) command must be supported (see below).

-   Any change to capacity must set a unit attention condition of CAPACITY DATA HAS CHANGED for all initiators with access to the logical unit.

-   READ(10).

-   WRITE(10). Support for force unit access (FUA) is mandatory for individual physical disk drives or RAID controllers that contain volatile (non-battery-backed) cache memory and must cause the data sent with this command to be committed to physical media before the command completes.

-   REASSIGN BLOCKS (hard disks only). RAID controllers that handle bad block replacement should succeed this command.

-   VERIFY (10).

-   START STOP UNIT. This command must not perform any other action, such as path failover.

-   SYNCHRONIZE CACHE (10) (no optional fields are used). For a physical disk drive, this command causes all data in the write cache to commit to physical media if write caching is enabled. Failure to follow this can result in data corruption.

Mode pages:

-   Mode Page 08h (Caching mode page) with the following bits must contain valid information: WCE (Write Cache Enable), CACHE SEGMENT SIZE, and NUMBER OF CACHE SEGMENTS (optional). RBC devices support Page 6 instead of Page 8 (WCD, WRITED, FORMATD, and LOCKD bits).

    -   If a device supports disabling write caching through the use of the WCE bit, this bit must also be reported as changeable and be supported by a MODE SELECT operation which modifies it. The status of the write caching must be visible by reading Mode Page 8. Vendors can implement caching policies outside of the limited SBC ones, and disabling of write cache does not need to be through this mode page.

-   Mode Page 0Ah (Control mode page) is required.

-   Mode Page 1Ah (Power Condition mode page) is required

Disk devices that support greater than 2-TB logical units (including 1394 disks). Devices must conform to SPC-3 and must implement all of the following in accordance with the SCSI Block Commands-2 (SBC-2) specification:

-   READ CAPACITY (16)

-   READ (16)

-   WRITE (16) FUA (bit must be supported if a volatile cache is present on the device)

-   VERIFY (16)

-   REASSIGN BLOCKS. LONGLBA field must be supported.

**Erasable SCSI Disk Devices **

Erasable SCSI disk devices must also support the following commands or features:

-   ERASE: Full-side and selected-block erase.

-   Format requirements reported with FORMAT command.

-   MODE SENSE (6) Total spare blocks available, write protect status.

-   PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL and START STOP UNIT.

-   REASSIGN BLOCKS and READ DEFECT DATA (10).

    WRITE without pre-erase, for erasable optical only.

**"Command completion time" is defined as the time between a command leaving the Microsoft port / miniport driver and the command completion being returned to the Microsoft port / miniport driver. If the command is failed with error status, this time also includes the subsequent Request Sense command leaving the Microsoft port / miniport driver and the Request Sense command completion being returned to the Microsoft port / miniport driver.**

All the command execution time performance measurement should be performed on media conforming to media physical layer standard specification from associated committees - i.e., DVD Forum, BDA, DVD+RW Alliance. Also, they should be performed under normal temperature and humidity operational condition as declared in the device specification.

**Note:** Read-Only drives will be retired from the Windows certification Program on June 01, 2010. Hence, certification requirements and tests will cease to exist for Read-Only drives on June 01, 2010. Partners who wish to receive Windows certification on systems with Read-Only drives would still be able to. However, the Read-Only drive would fall under the "unclassified" category of devices.
Â 
<sup>1</sup>: Transfer length for the read and write performance tests is equal or smaller to a single ECC block (32 KB or 64 KB depending of the current media type, i.e., 64 KB for CD and BD, 32 KB for DVD).

<sup>2</sup>: Performance tests may be exercised at any speed reported as supported by the device, including 1x media speed if so reported as supported.

<sup>3</sup>: Drive ***must*** make use of write buffer and ***shall not*** delay command completion by any form of media access. If write buffer is full, drive ***must*** fail the write command with long write in progress sense information (02h/04h/08h).
Â 
<sup>4</sup>: The first hundred read I/O commands after media arrival or resume from StandBy power state or Set Cd Speed or Set Streaming are permitted a delay up to a cumulative total ofÂ Â 60 000 msec to complete to allow for additional spin-up time. These commands individually may take any duration up to a limit of 7 000 msec, but the cumulative time to complete all hundred commands shall not exceed 60 000 msec. Only the time between when a read command is sent to the device and that read command is completed by the device is accounted for, the time between two successive read commands is not accounted for (i.e., host delays are not measured).

<sup>6</sup>: The list of disc structure codes is limited to; physical format information (Format = 0x00, Address = 0), DVD-RAM medium status (Format = 0x09, Address = 0), DVD+RW write inhibit DCB (Format = 0x30 Address = 0x57444300), write protection status (Format = 0xC0 Address = 0)<sup>7</sup>:Dual Layer Write profile *will be required on 1 June 2010* for Blu-Ray drives of 9.5 mm height and smaller as well as DVD drives 7 mm height and smaller.Â This ends the previous exceptionÂ for these form factors.
