## Device.TrustedPlatformModule.TPM20

**Informative:** TPM hardware which shipped in a system qualified for Windows 10 version 1607 will be considered to pass Redstone 2 requirements until March 1, 2018, irrespective of newer requirements, at Microsoft’s discretion. This does not apply to any TPM which passed the tests with exceptions. This applies to all Device.TrustedPlatformModule.TPM20 subrequirements.

**Informative:** TPM hardware which completes qualification for Redstone 2 may continue to use that qualification until March 1, 2019, irrespective of newer compatibility requirements, at Microsoft’s discretion. This applies to all Device.TrustedPlatformModule.TPM20 subrequirements.

**Informative:** TPM hardware which shipped in a system certified for Windows Server 2016 will be considered to pass Redstone 2 certification requirements until March 1, 2019, irrespective of newer requirements, at Microsoft’s discretion. This does not apply to any TPM which passed the tests with exceptions. This applies to all Device.TrustedPlatformModule.TPM20 subrequirements.

> [!WARNING]
> Certification for Windows Server 2016, Azure Stack, and SDDC must continue to meet the Windows Hardware Compatibility Requirements as stated in version 1607 of documentation, must use [version 1607 of the HLK (build 14393)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=404112) with [matching playlist](http://aka.ms/hlkplaylist) and supplemental content to generate logs, and must follow policies as stated in the [Windows Server Policy document](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834831). Questions about the Azure Stack or SDDC programs or how to submit the results for solution validation should be directed to the appropriate Microsoft technical account manager or partner management contact.

**Description**

**Mandatory:** The TPM shall Comply with the following performance requirements. These are measured with a tool which issues commands from the OS context.  Times specified as a mean refer to the mean of 100 or more operations completed in direct succession. For operations on keys other than import, the operations may be assumed to be being completed on imported (internal) keys.

**Mandatory:** TPM hardware in general must provide reasonable performance for an interactive user experience.  Microsoft reserves the right to modify any prospective requirements, including adding additional test cases, as it deems appropriate.

   -   RSA Prime Caching: For TPM2_Create to create an RSA 2048 bit key, if the TPM is able to create 5 keys in a maximum of 1 second each in direct succession, starting 5s after first boot by the end user, they may otherwise generate keys within double the allotted time below.

In the below table, if unspecified, all TPM_ALG_RSA keys are 2048 bit keys and TPM_ALG_ECC keys are of the TPM_ECC_NIST_256 curve.

**Description**

**Mandatory:** All TPMs must contain a full Endorsement Key (EK) certificate
stored in the TPM NV RAM as described in the "TCG EK Credential Profile for TPM
Family 2.0, Level 0, Revision 14" or be capable of retrieving such a certificate
on first boot.

The device may not be designed such that it contains a key with an associated
certificate from the TPM manufacturer which would allow the device to generate
EK Certificates.

**Mandatory:** Effective July 28, 2020, the TPM must include an EK Certificate
for the TPM\_ECC\_NIST\_P384 curve.

| TPM Artifact          | NV Index   | Required                                                                    |
|-----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EK Certificate        | 0x01c00002 | Yes. This must be a certificate associated with an RSA 2048 bit key.        |
| EK nonce (Deprecated) | 0x01c00003 | **Deprecated. This field must not be populated.**                           |
| EK template           | 0x01c00004 | Optional, populate only if non-default values are used for the EK template. |
| EK Certificate        | 0x01c0000a | Yes. This must be a certificate associated with a TPM\_ECC\_NIST\_P256 key. |
| EK nonce (Deprecated) | 0x01c0000b | **Deprecated. This field must not be populated.**                           |
| EK template           | 0x01c0000c | Optional, populate only if non-default values are used for the EK template. |

Any EK certificates beyond those stored in 0x01c00002 and 0x01c0000a must be
stored at NV Indices starting at 0x01c00012. Each even index may store an EK
Certificate. The subsequent odd location shall store the associated template if
required. A nonce may not be present in a separate NV Index and instead must be
included in the template if needed. If a custom template is required to generate
the associated EK, it must be included in whole in the associated index such
that the template may be passed to TPM2\_CreatePrimary.

**How Windows 10 handles legacy EK Certificate nonces**

If a nonce is present in 0x01c00003, it will be copied to the beginning of the
unique.rsa.buffer field in the template. The unique field will be padded to
match the length of the modulus of the key. The unique.rsa.size field will be
set appropriately to match. The resulting template will be passed to the
TPM2\_CreatePrimary command. Any present nonce and template must, when processed
using this process, generate the EK associated with the EK Certificate for the
Nonce and Template.

If a nonce is present in 0x01c0000b, it will be copied into the beginning of the
unique.ecc.x.buffer field in the template. The unique.ecc.x.size field will be
set appropriately to match. The resulting template will be passed to the
TPM2\_CreatePrimary command. Any present nonce and template must, when generated
using this process, generate the EK associated with the EK Certificate for the
Nonce and Template.

The EK certificate must be capable of being written to the TPM NVRAM in such a
way that the action of clearing the TPM does not delete the EK certificate.

The certificate must have the EKU specified that indicates that it is indeed an
EK Certificate. The OID used for this purpose is "2.23.133.8.1".

The EK certificate may also be signed using ECDSA. The supported ECC curves for
this purpose are NIST 256, NIST 384 and NIST 521.

The EK certificate must contain an AIA extension that contains the URL for the
issuing CA Certificate in the certificate chain.

The AIA extension must also be present in each non-root cert in the chain with
URLs that make the issuing CA certificate (any intermediate CA certs and the
root CA cert) – discoverable and retrievable via iterative fetching when
starting only with a single EK cert. For more information on AIA extension,
please refer to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=717890.
