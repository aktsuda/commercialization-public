**Description**

If a portable device can capture audio content, it must do so in a format that Windows understands natively.

The following tables represent the list of in-box formats that Windows will render to; this is not the exhaustive of supported formats in Windows. The full list of formats supported can be found at: <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=242995&clcid=0x409>.

**Note** that for a given format in the tables below it is not required to support all given Bit rates and Sample rates, it is however required to support a format that lines up within the ranges provided.

### Device.Portable.Core.CustomDeviceServices

*A portable device that implements custom MTP Services must meet the requirements defined in the MTP Devices Services Extension Specification.*

**Description**

The MTP Device Services Extension to the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) helps an MTP Initiator, in this case Windows, find and access certain types of content stored on the device.  Extension mechanisms have been defined that provide greater flexibility for applications that deal with specific content types defined by the device. These mechanisms provide greater extensibility than the existing data code mechanisms currently defined by the Media Transfer Protocol Specification, Revision 1.0.

If the portable device supports a custom device service, the implementation must have a valid *ServiceInfo* dataset, a valid *ServiceCapabilities* dataset, and a valid *ServicePropertiesDesc* dataset as defined in the MTP Device Services Extension Specification. All mandatory properties defined in the specification must be supported in the custom service.

The following table is a list of operations that are required when implementing MTP Services:

| Operation              | MTP Datacode | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GetServiceIDs          | 0x9301       | This operation returns an array of ServiceIDs.                                                                                                                                            |
| GetServiceInfo         | 0x9302       | This operation returns the ServiceInfo dataset for a service.                                                                                                                             |
| GetServiceCapabilities | 0x9303       | All object format and method format information is reported by using the GetServiceCapabilities operation.                                                                                |
| GetServicePropDesc     | 0x9304       | This operation returns theServicePropertyDesc dataset for a service.                                                                                                                      |
| GetServicePropList     | 0x9305       | This operation is similar to GetObjectPropList in the MTP specification, Revision 1.0. GetServicePropList reads properties from a service.                                                |
| SetServicePropList     | 0x9306       | This operation sets a ServiceProperty by using the ServicePropList dataset. It enables the writing of property values to a service.                                                       |
| UpdateObjectPropList   | 0x9307       | This operation sets the property list for a particular object that will be updated with a new binary object. This operation can be used to replace the binary data of an existing object. |
| DeleteObjectPropList   | 0x9308       | This operation removes the properties that are specified in the DeleteObjectPropList dataset from the specified object or objects.                                                        |
| DeleteServicePropList  | 0x9309       | This operation removes the properties that are specified in the DeleteServicePropList dataset from the specified service.                                                                 |

 
If scenarios that can be implemented using capabilities defined in the MTP specification are not implemented using the operations, device properties, etc. defined in the MTP 1.0 specification (or later), then the device must define these scenarios in terms of device services and must support these services according to the requirements defined in the MTP Device Services Extension Specification. For example, a media exchange service may be defined to manage media synchronization between the initiator and responder that replaces functionality supported by standard MTP 1.0 behavior.

To expose a custom device service in Device Stage, a custom task must be authored and defined as part of the Device Stage authoring process. This is described in the Microsoft Device Experience Development Kit.

**Description**

The MTP Device Services architecture enables Windows to locate and use various services and content types located on a device. By creating extensions to the WPD API and MTP protocol, Windows can locate, consume, and interact with useful content and services on the device.

Supported Personal Information Management (PIM) Services:

-   Contact Service
-   Calendar Service
-   Notes Service
-   Tasks Service

Other Supported Services:

-   Status Service
-   Hints Service
-   Device Metadata Service
-   Ringtones Service
-   SMS Service

If the device supports one or more of the PIM services, it must also support one of two synchronization services to actually synchronize the data. Windows supports the following in-box:

-   Enumeration Sync
-   Anchor Sync

It is up to the manufacturer to choose the services that is best suited for the device.

Vendors who choose to support custom Device Stage metadata packages, should ensure that the appropriate tasks or device properties are exposed correctly within the package.

For services to be accessible by a service aware initiator, the following service related operations must also be supported by the device:

| Operation              | MTP Datacode | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Description**

An MTP based device must be able to transfer data to and from a PC using a Windows based application that supports MTP.

**Note** that if the device replaces core MTP media handling functionality with a custom MTP Service, then interoperability with Windows Media Player will not function as expected. Devices that implement a custom service must have functional parity with core MTP operations to support media transfer and synchronization with a WPD-based application.

The following requirements must be met when interacting with Windows Media Player:

**Supports digital media transfers from device to computer -** The device must support digital media transfers to computers through applications that enable such transfers, such as the Portable Device Shell Namespace Extension and Windows Media Player.

**Supports digital media transfers from computer to device -** The device must support the transfer of supported media formats from the computer to the device through Windows Media Player. The device must support the transfer of all file formats from the computer to the device through the Windows® Namespace Extension.

**Supports metadata updates - **The device must support updates to MTP metadata after the original track has been copied to the device. The metadata updates are performed using Windows Media Player.

**Supports cancellation of transfer and synchronization -** The device must support cancellations of transfers and synchronizations mid-task without crashing or hanging of the device.

**Properly identifies file types -** The device must not rely on the file name extension of a file to discover the file type. The device can use the MTP object format or can parse the file contents to determine the file type.

**Provide device object metadata -** If a host sends an empty value for Album, Artist, or Title, the device must display meaningful text in place of the empty metadata and allow the user to find the content when searching on the associated field in the device UI. For example, a device might use Unknown Artist for the artist when it receives an empty value for artist metadata. If the device supports displaying genre metadata, then if a host sends an empty value for genre, the device must display meaningful text in place of the empty metadata and allow the user to find the content when searching on the associated field in the device UI.

**Playlist transfer -** The device must support the transfer of playlists manually created by the user using Windows Media Player. When a manual playlist is transferred using Windows Media Player, both the playlist and the content the playlist references must reside on the device.

To receive playlists from Windows Media Player, a device must support object references. If object references are supported, they must be supported on all media file formats. Support for object references is indicated by supporting the following commands:

-   GetObjectReferences (0x9810)
-   SetObjectReferences (0x9811)

The device must also support the AbstractAudioVideoPlaylist (0xBA05) format. A playlist is sent as a 0-byte object with a list of references to object handles for all objects contained in the playlist.

### Device.Portable.Core.ModelID

*Portable devices may support the optional ModelID property to uniquely identify logical device functions on a multi-function device.*

<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Plug and Play includes support for a DevNode property called DEVPKEY\_Device\_ModelId. This key is used to store the ModelID value that some devices will store in a device-class-specific or manufacturer-specific manner on the device.

The ModelID spans logical device functions on a multi-function device through an internal structure in Windows 7 called the Display Object that aggregates logical devices in a single "piece of plastic" representation.  The ModelID can be as specific or as generic as the manufacturer chooses. For example, ModelID may differ between product models, colors of an individual model, or even individual devices. To support ModelID, the device property code 0xD302 along with required properties must be supported.

*Design Notes*

-   Refer to the MTP Device Services Extension Specification that is included with the Windows Portable Device Enabling Kit, available at <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463545>.

### Device.Portable.Core.MTP

*Portable devices must support a core set of MTP operations and devices properties as defined in the Media Transport Protocol revision 1.0 or later, along with the device properties and object formats for the specific device type.*

**Description**

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is an extension of the Picture Transfer Protocol (ISO 15740).  Both specifications include optional commands and operations, but some of these are required for certification. There is a core set of operations and device properties that must be met by each device category in order to be compliant with Windows. Implementation details for MTP are defined in the Media Transfer Protocol Specification, Revision 1.0 or later and will be used as the reference for certification of all portable devices as part of the Windows Hardware Certification Program.

 
**Supports MTP drivers**
A portable device must work with the inbox MTP drivers that ship with Windows. This means that they must install and work immediately without requiring the installation of additional drivers or software.

**Supports MTP by default**
Portable devices must ship with MTP enabled as the default connection mode. Devices can support Mass Storage Class (MSC) in addition to MTP.

-   The device must not have a persistent, user accessible setting to enable or disable the MTP or MSC mode.

-   All storage volumes on a device (both internal and external) must be accessible using the MTP protocol.

A device can have a safe mode that allows the user to boot to the MSC mode for device recovery scenarios. After the user disconnects a device connected in safe mode, the device must resume normal operation.

See **Operations** in the MTP Specification, Revision 1.0 or later for complete list of defined MTP Operations.

The following operations are highly recommended, though not required:

-   FormatStore (0x100F)
-   GetObjectPropList (0x9805)
-   SetObjectPropList (0x9806)
-   GetInterDependentPropDesc (0x9807)
-   SendObjectPropList (0x9808) - For this command, your device must also support specification of destination, which allows the MTP initiator to dictate a parent handle for that object.

**Required Events**
The following events must be supported for all objects:

-   ObjectAdded (0x4002)
-   ObjectRemoved (0x4003)

If the device supports removable media, it must also support the following events.

-   StoreAdded (0x4004)
-   StoreRemoved (0x4005)

**Operation Responses**
An appropriate response must be returned for any and all operations. If an error is encountered, error response codes are also defined and must be provided by the device. For more information, see the "Responses" section of the MTP specification.

(1) Portable devices that are capable of playing audio and/or video must support at least one of these formats. This table does not represent the complete list of supported formats; it represents the list of commonly used formats.
See **Object Formats** in the MTP Specification, Revision 1.0 or later for complete list of defined Device Properties.

(2) Support for the following object properties is mandatory for AbstractAudioAlbum objects:

-   Genre (0xDC8C)
-   Album Artist (0xDC9B)
-   WMPMetadataRoundTrip (0x9201)

A device that supports both the AbstractAudioAlbum format and an image format may optionally support album art. Album art is attached to an AbstractAudioAlbum object by adding the art to the album's RepresentativeSampleData property.

If a Portable Device supports album art, then the device must support the following object properties:

-   PurchaseFlag (0xd901), an object property in the Windows Media DRM 10 for Portable Devices MTP Extensions
-   RepresentativeSampleFormat (0xdc81)
-   RepresentativeSampleSize (0xdc82)
-   RepresentativeSampleHeight (0xdc83)
-   RepresentativeSampleWidth (0xdc84)
-   RepresentativeSampleData (0xdc86)
-   User Rating (0xdc8a)

**Description**

A Windows portable device that supports MTP over IP must comply with the Camera and Imaging Products Association (CIPA) PTP over Internet Protocol (PTP/IP) specification (CIPA-005/2005), which extends the PTP specification to use TCP/IP to perform PTP operations over wireless networks.

 
An MTP/IP device must support the following three technologies to ensure compatibility with the PC:

1. **UPnP Basic Device**

	MTP/IP devices must support Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) discovery as a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP„¢) basic device. Refer to the MTP Network Association Extension definition for details.

2. **Picture Transfer Protocol over IP**

	MTP/IP devices must comply with the Camera and Imaging Products Association (CIPA) PTP over Internet Protocol (PTP/IP) specification (CIPA-005/2005), which extends the PTP specification to use TCP/IP to perform PTP operations over wireless networks.

3. **MTP Network Association Extension**

	MTP/IP devices must comply with the Wi-Fi-provisioning extension to the MTP specification and the MTP Network Association extension to the MTP specification.

Support for this MTP extension is indicated by including the following string in the MTPVendorExtensionDesc field of the MTP DeviceInfo dataset, returned as a response to the MTP GetDeviceInfo operation.

| Dataset field          | Datatype                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| MTPVendorExtensionDesc | "microsoft.com/WPDNA: 1.0" |

 
The device property defined by this extension supports Network Association configuration for devices that support Zero or Nominal Authentication. Secure Authentication is not supported by this extension; secure authentication can be implemented via a custom MTP Service if desired. Refer to the MTP Network Association Extension definition for details.

**Recommendations for Network Provisioning**

The MTP Wi-Fi Provisioning Extension extends the Windows Connect Now architecture to MTP devices. This extension defines a new MTP object format for WFC (Wireless Configuration File) objects. A WFC object contains the network settings that will allow the responder to join a wireless network. An initiator supporting the WCN architecture will be able to transfer WFC objects to the device. Each WFC object represents the settings for a single wireless network. The responder may receive multiple WFC objects over time. Each object will be named according to the SSID of the network.

The following DataType must be included in the MTPVendorExtensionDesc field of the DeviceInfo dataset.

| Dataset field          | Datatype                    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| MTPVendorExtensionDesc | "microsoft.com/WPDWCN: 1.0" |

 
**Recommendations for Improved Performance over IP**
In order to mitigate format enumeration performance issues, MTP/IP devices should also support the **GetFormatCapabilities** operation as defined in the MTP Device Services Extensions Specification. This operation improves the performance of querying a device for the supported object properties on formats that are associated with classic MTP storages (those formats that appear in the DeviceInfo dataset). GetFormatCapabilities is a bulk operation that duplicates the functionality of GetObjectPropsSupported, GetObjectPropDesc, and GetInterdependentPropDesc. Responders should implement this operation because it replaces multiple calls to the device with a single, more efficient call.

*Design Notes*

-   Refer to the PTP/IP Specification (CIPA-005/2005) "Picture Transfer Protocol over TCP/IP Networks".

-   MTP Device Services Extension Specification at <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463545>.

-   MTP Network Association, MTP Windows Connect Now, and MTP Wi-Fi Provisioning Extension documents are available at <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463543>.

### Device.Portable.Core.TransportIPDLNA

*A Portable Device that functions as a DMR or DMS conforms to requirements defined for Networked Media Devices.*

<p>Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) x64</p>
<p>Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) x86</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Portable devices can implement one or more of the DLNA device classes such as:

-   Digital Media Renderer (DMR)
-   Digital Media Server (DMS)

The device must meet the requirements defined for each device class called out in the Networked Media Device section of the Windows Hardware Certification Program Requirements. DLNA is managed independent of MTP.

*Design Notes*

-   Refer to the Networked Media Device section for requirement details. Information on DLNA Certification can be found at [http://www.dlna.org](http://www.dlna.org/).

### Device.Portable.Core.TransportUSB

*If a Portable Device leverages the USB transport, then the device shall support the latest required specification(s) for that transport and related tests: USB (Specification Version 2.0 or greater).*

<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

A portable device that uses USB must use the following:

-   USB Core specification Version 2.0 (with latest errata) or newer \[<http://www.usb.org/developers/docs>\]

-   USB MTP DWG Specification 1.0 (with latest errata) or newer \[<http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs>\]

*Design Notes*

-   USB connected devices must support both High-Speed and Full-Speed. Super-Speed is optional.

-   The connection must be implemented according to requirements in the appropriate connection type section.

-   There are no specific Windows Hardware Certification requirements for the type of USB connector used on a portable device.

### Device.Portable.Core.VideoCodec

*If a portable device has the ability to capture video content, it must do so using a format supported natively in Windows.*

<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

If a portable device can capture video content, it must do so in a format that Windows can decode natively without the need for additional codecs to be installed.

The following tables represent the list of in-box formats that Windows will render to; this is not the exhaustive of supported formats. The full list of formats supported can be found at: <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=242995&clcid=0x409>.

**Note** that for a given format in the tables below it is not required to support all given Bit rates and Sample rates, it is however required to support a format that lines up within the ranges provided.

**Description**

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is an extension of the Picture Transfer Protocol (ISO 15740).  Both specifications include optional commands and operations, but some of these are required for certification. There is a core set of operations and device properties that must be met by each device category in order to be compliant with Windows. Implementation details for MTP are defined in the Media Transfer Protocol Specification, Revision 1.0 or later and will be used as the reference for certification of all portable devices as part of the Windows Hardware Certification Program.

**Required Operations**

This core set of MTP operations and device properties must be met by each portable device in order to be compliant with Windows.  Implementation details for each operation and device property are defined in the Media Transfer Protocol Specification, Revision 1.0 or later.

Where:<br/>
R = Required<br/>
I = If Implemented (Optional)<br/>
N/A = Not Applicable<br/>

See **Operations** in the MTP Specification, Revision 1.0 or later for complete list of defined MTP Operations.

The following operations are highly recommended, though not required:

-   FormatStore (0x100F)
-   GetObjectPropList (0x9805)
-   SetObjectPropList (0x9806)
-   GetInterDependentPropDesc (0x9807)
-   SendObjectPropList (0x9808) - For this command, your device must also support specification of destination, which allows the MTP initiator to dictate a parent handle for that object.

**Required Events**

The following events must be supported for all objects:

-   ObjectAdded (0x4002)
-   ObjectRemoved (0x4003)

If the device supports removable media, it must also support the following events.

-   StoreAdded (0x4004)
-   StoreRemoved (0x4005)

**Operation Responses**

An appropriate response must be returned for any and all operations. If an error is encountered, error response codes are also defined and must be provided by the device. For more information, see the "Responses" section of the MTP specification.

Where:</br/>
R = Required</br/>
I = If Implemented (Optional)</br/>
N/A = Not Applicable

See **Operations** in the MTP Specification, Revision 1.0 or later for complete list of defined MTP Operations.
The following operations are highly recommended, though not required:

-   FormatStore (0x100F)
-   GetObjectPropList (0x9805)
-   SetObjectPropList (0x9806)
-   GetInterDependentPropDesc (0x9807)
-   SendObjectPropList (0x9808) - For this command, your device must also support specification of destination, which allows the MTP initiator to dictate a parent handle for that object.

**Required Events**

The following events must be supported for all objects:

-   ObjectAdded (0x4002)
-   ObjectRemoved (0x4003)

If the device supports removable media, it must also support the following events.

-   StoreAdded (0x4004)
-   StoreRemoved (0x4005)

**Operation Responses**

An appropriate response must be returned for any and all operations. If an error is encountered, error response codes are also defined and must be provided by the device. For more information, see the "Responses" section of the MTP specification.

**Description**

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is an extension of the Picture Transfer Protocol (ISO 15740).  Both specifications include optional commands and operations, but some of these are required for certification. There is a core set of operations and device properties that must be met by each device category in order to be compliant with Windows. Implementation details for MTP are defined in the Media Transfer Protocol Specification, Revision 1.0 or later and will be used as the reference for certification of all portable devices as part of the Windows Hardware Certification Program.

**Required Operations**

This core set of MTP operations and device properties must be met by each portable device in order to be compliant with Windows.  Implementation details for each operation and device property are defined in the Media Transfer Protocol Specification, Revision 1.0 or later.

The following operations are highly recommended, though not required:

-   FormatStore (0x100F)
-   GetObjectPropList (0x9805)
-   SetObjectPropList (0x9806)
-   GetInterDependentPropDesc (0x9807)
-   SendObjectPropList (0x9808) - For this command, your device must also support specification of destination, which allows the MTP initiator to dictate a parent handle for that object.

**Required Events**

The following events must be supported for all objects:

-   ObjectAdded (0x4002)
-   ObjectRemoved (0x4003)

If the device supports removable media, it must also support the following events.

-   StoreAdded (0x4004)
-   StoreRemoved (0x4005)

**Operation Responses**

An appropriate response must be returned for any and all operations. If an error is encountered, error response codes are also defined and must be provided by the device. For more information, see the "Responses" section of the MTP specification.

**Description**

Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is an extension of the Picture Transfer Protocol (ISO 15740).  Both specifications include optional commands and operations, but some of these are required for certification. There is a core set of operations and device properties that must be met by each device category in order to be compliant with Windows. Implementation details for MTP are defined in the Media Transfer Protocol Specification, Revision 1.0 or later and will be used as the reference for certification of all portable devices as part of the Windows Hardware Certification Program.

**Required Operations**

This core set of MTP operations and device properties must be met by each portable device in order to be compliant with Windows.  Implementation details for each operation and device property are defined in the Media Transfer Protocol Specification, Revision 1.0 or later.

(1) Portable devices that are capable of playing audio and/or video must support at least one of these formats. This table does not represent the complete list of supported formats; it represents the list of commonly used formats.

See **Object Formats** in the MTP Specification, Revision 1.0 or later for complete list of defined Device Properties.

(2) Support for the following object properties is mandatory for AbstractAudioAlbum objects:

-   Genre (0xDC8C)
-   Album Artist (0xDC9B)
-   WMPMetadataRoundTrip (0x9201)

A device that supports both the AbstractAudioAlbum format and an image format may optionally support album art. Album art is attached to an AbstractAudioAlbum object by adding the art to the album's RepresentativeSampleData property.
If a Portable Device supports album art, then the device must support the following object properties:

-   PurchaseFlag (0xd901), an object property in the Windows Media DRM 10 for Portable Devices MTP Extensions
-   RepresentativeSampleFormat (0xdc81)
-   RepresentativeSampleSize (0xdc82)
-   RepresentativeSampleHeight (0xdc83)
-   RepresentativeSampleWidth (0xdc84)
-   RepresentativeSampleData (0xdc86)
-   User Rating (0xdc8a)
-   WMPMetadataRoundTrip (0x9201)
