**Description**

Biometric fingerprint readers certified under this program must be exposed through the Windows Biometric Framework (WBF). WBF plug-in components must implement all entry points and adhere to the WBF plug-in interfaces that are documented on MSDN ([*http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd401553.aspx*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd401553.aspx)).

The following general criteria must be met:

- The driver package must contain a WBDI driver, and a combination of plug-in adapters.
- Devices that operate in the advanced mode may implement a compound adapter. A compound adapter may contain a proprietary sensor, engine, and database adapter, or any combination of these adapters.
- The WBDI driver and plug-in components must not contain any malicious software such as Trojan horse or backdoor software.

All devices (peripheral or embedded) that leverage Windows Hello experiences for logon or user authentication must follow Windows Hello design language:  

- Windows provided biometric enrollment applications must be used to collect the userâ€™s biometric data to generate a valid biometric template.    
- Windows Setting page must be used to manage the enrolled biometric data.   
- Windows feedback string above the lock screen (combined with glyphs) must be used to communicate to users about error cases (an unknown finger swiped) or instructions (move away) 

The plug-in components must not contain any malicious software such as Trojan horse or backdoor software.

The following table lists the hardware requirements for fingerprint sensors.

**Design Notes: **

Biometric devices measure an unchanging physical characteristic to uniquely identify an individual. Fingerprints are one of the most common biometric characteristic measured. Beginning with Windows 7, a new set of components, the Windows Biometric Framework, provides support for fingerprint biometric devices. These components, created using the Windows Biometric Framework API, can perform the following tasks:

- Capture biometric samples and use them to create a template.
- Securely save and retrieve biometric templates.
- Map each template to a unique identifier such as a GUID (globally unique identifier) or SID (system identifier).
- Enroll new biometric templates.

For more complete information about WBF and its components, see the "Introduction to the Windows Biometric Framework (WBF)" white paper at (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/gg463089.aspx)

**Description**

-   All interface entry points must be implemented, and each element must adhere to the definition of its respective adapter plug-in interface.

-   Plug-in components must support the sequenced invocation of their interfaces that result from invoking all the top-level Windows Biometric Framework (WBF) APIs.

-   The sequence of WBF API calls used by the WBF credential provider for Windows logon must be completed in 1.5 seconds or less.

-   The adapter must run under Application Verifier without generating any errors.

A driver package can support multiple devices, but must pass the certification criteria for each of the supported fingerprint readers separately. A separate submission must be made for each supported device.

**Description**

Windows Biometric Driver Interface (WBDI) drivers must adhere to the following criteria:

-   All mandatory IOCTLs must be fully implemented and adhere to the WBDI specification.

-   If an optional IOCTL is implemented, it must adhere to the WBDI specification.

-   The WBDI driver must support the biometric IOCTL calling sequence.

-   If the biometric fingerprint reader is not a PnP device, it must create arrival and departure events as recommended in the WBDI specification.

-   The WBDI INF installer must set up the associated plug-in components and fingerprint management applications that are included in the driver package.

Guidelines in this requirement apply equally well to the kernel-mode and user-mode drivers. The following must be supported:

-   Backward and forward compatibility. Drivers must have a mechanism that determines different versions of user-mode and kernel-mode components. When two versions of the same driver have been installed on the PC, the kernel component must determine the correct driver to talk to. In remoting scenarios, the mismatch may occur even with a single driver.

The following items must not be used:

-   Out-of-band communications. Because the user-mode and kernel-mode drivers are running on the same PC, they might be coupled together through channels different from the I/O manager APIs. The goal is to ensure that drivers do not have out-of-band communication, implicit or explicit.

Here are some specific examples that would prevent terminal services redirection:

-   Shared memory must not be used directly between user-mode applications and either user-mode or kernel-mode drivers. For every data item sent and received, there must be a corresponding I/O request. Share the memory either through a mapped file or through locked pages of one direct I/O call.

-   Registry communication (that is, any registry keys that are set from user-mode drivers and read from kernel-mode drivers or vice versa). It is problematic when an application is running on the server and drivers are loaded on the client because the registry is set on the server, but not on the client.

-   Kernel objects (passing any kernel object handles in I/O buffers, such as handles to events or semaphores).

-   Data pointers (passing data pointers in I/O buffers). For example, a driver may try to read a linked list or other complicated data structure from the kernel.

-   Incompatibility between 32-bit and 64-bit platform implementations of the I/O request packet (IRP) requests (fields in the data structures that are compiled differently, depending on the bitness). Incompatibility of the structures based on bitness results in different offsets and data size for these structures. The data will not be interpreted correctly when a terminal services client and server are not the same platform.

-   Reliance on a strict timing expectation about how fast the kernel driver responds. Because drivers are remoting over the network, additional latency is added to the response from the hardware. That latency may range from 10 ms to serveral seconds. A possible cause for this could be slow network or packet losses. If a driver is programmed for a response that comes in time less than usual network latency, the remoting fails.

    Setting an access control list (ACL) or any other run-time security check that would prevent any application from opening a device driver. For example, a driver is allowed to accept calls only from particular service. Because all the calls are done on a TS client PC under security context of the remoting client process, they can fail.

-   To expose a device through WBF, the device must be exposed through a driver that implements the WBDI driver as well as an appropriate combination of sensor, engine, and database plug-in components.
