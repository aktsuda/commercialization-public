<p>Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) x64</p>
<p>Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

All user-mode modules (.dll or .exe files) that are part of a printer driver must satisfy the criteria for Application Verifier tests. During driver testing, Application Verifier must be turned on for processes in which the driver modules execute. Application Verifier causes a break when Application Verifier detects an error.
For printer drivers, common applications that must have Application Verifier turned on during testing are the following:

-   Splwow64.exe.

-   Spoolsv.exe. The process loads the rendering and UI portions of the driver during print testing.

-   Printfilterpipelinesvc.exe. The process loads the XPS rendering filters.

-   Any vendor-supplied applications that are part of the driver package, such as a custom status monitor. All portions of the driver package that is being signed must be robust.

-   Any tests that load driver modules for rendering or UI purposes. The tests commonly load UI and rendering modules.

The following Application Verifier tests must be turned on for these processes during testing:

-   Heap
-   Locks
-   Handles
-   FilePaths
-   HighVersionLie
-   DFWChecksNonSetup
-   SecurityChecks
-   Printing

*Design Notes*

For information about Application Verifier, see <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=58371>*.*

</td></tr></table>

**Description**

If a computer becomes unavailable during a print job (for example, if the computer enters a sleep state or a network failure or other event interrupts the connection between the computer and printer), the printer must recover so that normal print operations can continue without user interaction.

*Design Notes*

Specifically, the printer must not fail into a state in which the end user must manually power cycle the printer or clear a paper jam.
The printer does not have to complete or continue the failed print job when the computer becomes available again. However, when computer-to-printer communication is restored, new print jobs must be able to spool and complete normally.

### Device.Imaging.Printer.Base.deviceCapabilities

*A printer must correctly support the DeviceCapabilities and GetDeviceCaps application programming interfaces (APIs) based on the guidelines in the Windows Driver Kit.*

</td></tr></table>

**Description**

This requirement clarifies the use of existing WLK tests.
INFGate determines whether INF files and v4 manifest use the correct syntax according to the WDK.
Version 4 print drivers use version 4 INFs and manifest files.
V4 driver INF must:

-   Define a PrinterDriverID for each driver in the INF to indicate when drivers are compatible for the sake of printer sharing.

   -   PrinterDriverID must be a GUID.

-   Set a DataFile as a GPD or PPD file.

-   EnumPrintProcessorDatatypesW
-   PrintDocumentOnPrintProcessor
-   GetPrintProcessorCapabilities

For more information, see <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff566084.aspx>*.*

### Device.Imaging.Printer.Base.printRegions

*A printer must support printable regions accurately.*

<table>
<tr>
<th>Applies to</th>
<td>
<p>Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) x64</p>
<p>Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

The printer must be able to print output for the entire area that appears in the printable region that the user can select in the Windows UI.

*Design Notes*

Note that if the printer supports a "borderless" printing feature, this restriction may be relaxed to allow for devices whose printable region extends beyond the dimensions of the physical media sheet. In these cases, the printer must be able to print output to the extent of the page dimension.

This test applies to all paper sizes that the printer physically supports. If the printer supports auto-scaling and the UI exposes additional paper sizes to the user that cannot be physically loaded into the printer, the printer must maintain correct aspect ratios during resizing. In this context, "auto-scaling" is any feature in the hardware or driver that changes the print job to fit on an available paper size without user interaction or warning.

If the printer does not support printing on a physical medium that is at least 4" x 4" in size, the printer is exempt from this requirement.

### Device.Imaging.Printer.Base.printTicket

*A printer driver must support PrintTicket/PrintCapabilities.*

<table>
<tr>
<th>Applies to</th>
<td>
<p>Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) x64</p>

<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Print devices must fully support the **PrintTicket** and **PrintCapabilities** objects. Depending on your print driver implementation, this may or may not require implementing certain **PrintTicket** or **PrintCapabilities** interfaces. For more information, see the WDK documentation.

Printer drivers must support the public Print Schema element types for each keyword if the printer driver or print device includes the specified functionality. Printer drivers must also support the public Print Schema element types for each keyword if the appropriate functionality is present but non-configurable. The element types that the printer driver must support for each keyword include all such Features, Options, ParameterDef, ParameterRef, Property, and ScoredProperty that the public Print Schema definition contains. Printer drivers do not have to support public Print Schema keywords if the printer driver or print device does not include the specified functionality.

Printer drivers must support the following basic Print Schema element types:

-   DocumentCollate
-   JobCopiesAllDocuments
-   JobDuplexAllDocumentsContiguously
-   PageColorManagement
-   PageImageableSize
-   PageMediaSize
-   PageMediaType
-   PageOrientation
-   PageOutputColor
-   PageResolution
-   PageICMRenderingIntent
-   One of the following: JobInputBin, DocumentInputBin, or PageInputBin

</td></tr></table>

**Description**

This requirement clarifies the use of the following existing WLK tests to ensure that printers correctly render print jobs:

-   Pgremlin/Pgremlin2

	This test produces numerous pages of output that include shapes, gradient fills, alpha blends and some complex fonts. The test checks Device Driver Interface (DDI) calls that a driver can make.

-   WinFX Markup Content Rendering Test

	The WinFX Markup Content Rendering test loads eight WinFX XAML files and produces output on the specified printer.

-   Photo Print Test

	The Photo Print Test prints landscape- and portrait-oriented photos to exercise printer functionality.

**Description**

For Windows 10, a correctly implemented version 4 print driver will satisfy the XPS requirements.  The v4 driver can support either MSXPS or Open XPS.
V4 print drivers that support OpenXPS, either exclusively or in dual-format support mode with XPS, must satisfy the following requirements:

-   Driver manifest must specify either "XpsFormat=OpenXPS", "XpsFormat=OpenXPS, XPS" or "XpsFormat=XPS, OpenXPS" in the DriverRender section.

-   The first filter must be able to consume OpenXPS document format when provided such by the print filter pipeline manager.

-   All filters must conform to the rendering rules in the ECMA Open XML Paper Specification v. 1.0 (Ecma 388).

-   All filters must conform to the PrintTicket processing rules in the PrintSchema Specification 1.0.

-   The v4 driver filter pipeline must produce a PDL that the target print device can interpret.

-   Filters in the v4 driver pipeline that support OpenXPS must NOT do the following:

	<!-- -->

	-   Call into the Common Language Runtime (CLR) or the WinFX run-time components for any functionality.

	-   Display user interface (UI) content.

	<!-- -->

-   OpenXPS supporting drivers must adhere to all other v4 rules.  Dual-format drivers must adhere to both OpenXPS and MSXPS requirements and successfully handle either format.
