**Description**

With this feature, Windows apps can communicate over different PDP contexts (virtual channels) in mobile networks. Mobile Operators use different PDP contexts to create the differentiated experiences and innovative services. Third party app developers can use this feature to build great quality VOIP and video streaming experiences partnering with mobile operators.

Device firmware capable of multiple PDP contexts need to comply with the [MBIM specification](http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/MBIM10.zip). Specifically, device firmware should support multiple IP data streams as detailed in section 10.5.12.1 in the MBIM specification. This includes supporting all the control implementation of CIDs and IP data streams for full support of multiple PDP contexts.

Device firmware must support a total of 8 dual bearer (IPv4 & IPv6) PDP contexts for usage by Windows.

This includes 1 for internet connectivity and 7 additional for Operator Apps.

Devices are not required to expose their internal, firmware managed PDP contexts used for SMS and any other administration context to Windows.

Device firmware should be able to leverage host OS request for a PDP context that is already device managed internally in its firmware to be handled gracefully.

Device firmware should continue to abstract SMS PDP contexts and route them through the SMS CIDs regardless of the bearer used underneath.
