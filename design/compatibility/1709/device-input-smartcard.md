**Description**

Smart Card Minidrivers are pluggable security components that provide an abstraction layer between the base CSP and the smartcard to provide secure storage for cryptographic keys and certificates. Smart Card Minidrivers perform secure cryptographic operations including encryption, decryption, key establishment, key exchange, and digital signatures. Smart Card Minidrivers also include other form factors, such as a USB tokens or other personal trusted devices.
Smart Card Minidrivers must adhere to the following specifications:

-   Smart Card Minidriver Specification for Windows Base Cryptographic Service Provider (Base CSP) and Smart Card Key Storage Provider (KSP), Version 5.06 (or later).

-   Smart Card Minidriver Certification Criteria, Version 5.06 (or later).

Smart Card Minidrivers must adhere to the following basic criteria:

-   If the device submitted for testing is a smart card and has an ISO 7816 ID-1 smart card form factor, it must be tested with a smart card reader that has passed the WHQL Testing Requirements for smart cards.

-   If the device is a multi-function device, it must pass the logo requirements for each device category if a logo program exists.

-   The card minidriver may not implement additional functionality beyond that specified in the Card Minidriver Specification.

-   The card minidriver may not contain any Trojan's or "backdoors".

-   The card minidriver may not present any UI to the end user.

-   All cryptographic operations must take place on the device.

-   All cryptographic keys must be stored on the device and must not be exportable from the device.

Smart Card Minidrivers must adhere to the following general criteria in the Card Minidriver Certification Criteria:

-   Card Minidriver Management and Installation

-   Card Minidriver Logical File System Requirements

-   Card Minidriver General Conventions

-   Card Minidriver Memory Management

-   Optional General Requirements

Smart Card Minidriver must adhere to the criteria governing each of the Functional Exports for each function in the Card Minidriver specification, including:

-   Functionality

-   Performance

-   Error Handling

Smart Card Minidrivers must support the sequenced invocation of card minidriver functions.
A Smart Card Minidriver may support multiple smart cards, but must pass the certification criteria for each of the supported smart cards separately.

**Description**

To support multiple-protocol smart cards and smart cards that use higher data rates and higher clock frequencies, the reader must support negotiable and specific modes according to ISO/IEC 7816-3 (1997-12-15), Sections 5.4 and 7.
The **Power Down** command for ISO 7816-3 is optional, but the **Reset** command is required.
PTS is not required.

The smart card reader and the driver must support cards that can handle both protocols. Support is not required for protocols other than T=0 and T=1.
The following protocol rules apply for the T=1 protocol:

-   A transmission is defined as sending a command to a smart card by using one or more T=1 blocks and receiving the corresponding answer by using one or more T=1 blocks as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-3.

-   For cards that support IFSC requests, the first transmission after a reset of the smart card must begin with an IFSD request, as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-3, Amendment 1, Section 9.5.1.2.

-    For cards that do not support an IFSD request (that is, the card replies with an R-Block indicating "Other error"), the transmission must continue with an I-Block.

-   After a successful RESYNCH request, the transmission must restart from the beginning with the first block with which the transmission originally started.

 

### Device.Input.SmartCardReader.UsbCcidCompliesWithUsbDeviceClassSpec

<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

If the reader supports USB connectivity, CCID is required. To ensure that USB smart card readers function properly with the USB host, smart card CCID readers must comply with USB Device Class: Smart Card Specification for Integrated Circuit(s) Cards Interface Devices, Revision 1.00 or later.

### Device.Input.SmartCardReader.UsbCcidIssuesNak

*A USB CCID reader must issue an NAK on an interrupt pipe if a device has no interrupt data to transmit.*

<table>
<tr>
<td>Applies to</td>
<td>
<p>Windows 10 Client x64</p>
<p>Windows 10 Client x86</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

USB CCIDs must issue an NAK on an interrupt pipe unless the state changes. This prevents the necessity of repeatedly polling the device for status.
