-   Controller can detect device NACK during a write operation, complete the request with STATUS\_SUCCESS, and information bytes is set to a number of bytes that is less than what was intended to be written.

-   Controller can detect device NACK during a write operation of a sequence IOCTL, complete the request with STATUS\_SUCCESS, and information bytes is set to number of bytes that is less than what was intended to be written.
