**Description**

Devices must report supported band information for each respective category. In addition, device must comply with the following requirements.

**Driver Servicing**

 - Driver binary file version must match the version reported in the inf.
 - Driver service name must match the driver binary name.  


**Minimize CPU Utilization **

The Wi-Fi device should conform to the following requirements for minimizing CPU utilization.

-   While in EXTSTA mode and in D0 state, WLAN devices must not interrupt OS more than 1 time per data packet (non D0 coalesced packets only. If WLAN device supports D0 packet coalescing, WLAN device should comply with the D0 packet coalescing spec for D0 coalesced packets). Note that if WLAN device is using SDIO bus interface, interrupts generated by SDIO host controller per data packet are exempted from this requirement.  Non data packet-related interrupts, if needed, must not exceed an average of 3 interrupts per second when measured over a 2 minute period.  Also, as a best practice, in active state (when there is data traffic), the non-data packet related interrupts should be issued within 1 millisecond of a valid packet-related interrupt.

-   In D0 state, all (if any) miniport specific periodic maintenance timers must be specified using an available "timer coalescing" API, with a minimum 2 second period and 1 second tolerance.  This requirement will be tested in a long running connected state when there is no change in connectivity.  All such timers must be cancelled in D3 state.  Note that this requirement doesn't apply to timers defined in IEEE 802.11 specification e.g., connection timers such as association timers, roaming timers etc.  

-   An individual DPC (Deferred Procedural Call) duration MUST not exceed 2 milliseconds. Accumulated DPC duration should be less than 4 milliseconds over any 10 millisecond window.

In low power states, if the device is not Wake on Wireless capable, WLAN device must not interrupt the CPU. If the device is Wake on Wireless capable, WLAN device must not interrupt the CPU except on wake triggers indicated by NDIS for Wake on Wireless LAN. All interrupts not related to wake triggers must be cancelled.

**Support Multiple Device Instances **

Plug and Play can support multiple instances of a device. Multiple instances of the device can exist and function in the same system at the same instance. For network communications devices, the Plug and Play IDs and resource support MUST be sufficient to allow multiple network communications devices to be added automatically to the system. This requirement implies that all device resources MUST be set and read through the standard interfaces provided by the bus on which the device resides. For PCI devices, this interface is the PCI configuration space. Also, device parameter settings MUST be stored in the registry.

**Comply with following specifications: NDIS 6.50, WDF/KMDF **

Network device drivers must make only Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 6.50 or Windows Driver Foundation (WDF) calls. Any calls to kernel mode components are not allowed.

**Association Timing Requirement**

On WPA2-PSK networks, WLAN devices must finish the association within **300ms**.  It is measured as the time between the events when OS issues an OID "OID\_WDI\_TASK\_CONNECT" and miniport sends an "NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_ASSOCIATION\_RESULT" indication to the OS. 

**Device Initialization Timing Requirement**

WLAN devices must meet the following requirement during boot time, resume from hibernate, and device enable/disable actions.

Device must complete the OpenAdapterHandler routine within 1 second. Time is measured between when NDIS calls OpenAdapterHandler function as part of a system PnP operation and OpenAdapterCompleteHandler(NDIS\_STATUS\_SUCCESS) is returned. In OpenAdapterHandler, the driver must have completed all its device initialization.

**Radio State Change Timing Requirement**

WLAN devices must be able to change the state of the radio within 2 sec. This duration will be measured between the request is sent through OID\_WDI\_TASK\_SET\_RADIO\_STATE and when the miniport indicates NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_RADIO\_STATUS back.

**Scan Action Requirement**

WLAN device must start scanning when it receives a "OID\_WDI\_TASK\_SCAN " from OS and reply back with an indication " NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_SCAN\_COMPLETE " to the OS as soon as it completes the scan. In case of active scanning, miniport is expected to send the active wildcard probes to the network channels to meet the scanning goals. In case of passive scanning, miniport is not expected to send any probes to the network channels.

This priority order should be followed for scanning:

1.  NLO hint channels

2.  Preferred channels

3.  Any remaining channels

The timings listed below will be measured from the time stamp when the device receives OID "OID\_WDI\_TASK\_SCAN" from OS to the time stamp when the respective indication is provided to the OS by the miniport.

-   If the Network list offload hints are available, the device should leverage the network list offload hints to optimize scanning behavior and return "NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_NLO\_DISCOVERY" indication when a matching profile is found within the following timings:

	<!-- -->

	-   Scanning a network where active scanning is allowed - 20ms/channel

	-   Scanning a network where only passive scanning is allowed - 120ms/channel

	<!-- -->

-   If there is no match found using Network List Offload hints, WLAN device should next scan the preferred channels in the list above.  For scanning the channels in the preferred channel list, WLAN device should not take more than 3.5 seconds (time includes scanning for both active and passive channels). The newly created list of surrounding BSS entries should be returned on the next BSS list query from the OS.

-   If there is no match found in above 2 cases, WLAN device should next scan any remaining channels. WLAN device should not take more than 4 sec for the entire scan operation. 

**Scanning Behavior when Resuming from Sleep/Screen Off **

When resuming from sleep/screen off, the WLAN device is expected to reconnect to the same AP that it was connected to before going to sleep, if it is available. WLAN devices must meet the following timings for detecting its presence:

-   Reconnecting to a channel were active scanning is allowed - 50ms

-   Reconnecting to a channel were only Passive scanning is allowed - 120ms

If the last connected network is not found, WLAN device must scan for networks in the priority order listed below.

-   NLO hint channels

-   Preferred channels

-   Any remaining channels

WLAN device must follow the timing constraints as defined above in the general scanning section.  The timings will be measured from the time stamp when the device reports as being in D0 state (OID\_WDI\_SET\_POWER\_STATE completing) to the time stamp when the respective indication is provided to the OS by the miniport.

**Support Raw Action Frames (If-Implemented) (WDI drivers only)**

Raw Action Frames are required for transmitting ANQP Query/Response frames, 802.11k Neighbor Report/Request Frames,and 802.11v BSS Transition Management Report/Request Frames. The device must report that it supports Raw Action Frames in WDI\_GET\_ADAPTER\_CAPABILITIES. Please refer to the WDI Spec for implementation details. 802.11k Neighbor Reports and 802.11vBSS Transition Management Frames will be used to improve roaming performance in the operating system. By utilizing 802.11k Neighbor Reportsand 802.11v BSS Transition Management Frames, the OS has an improved understanding of its surroundings and allows for improved roaming performance, thus leading to less glitches for the end user when on a voice/video call.

**Support 802.11r Fast BSS Transition (If-Implemented) (WDI drivers only)**

802.11r Fast BSS Transitions allow for faster key exchange speeds, leading to improved roaming performance. The driver must support a new association type for Fast BSS Associations and be able to send the appropriate indications to the OS during the association/key exchange process. Please refer to the WDI spec from more information.

**Wi-Fi Power-Save Mode **

The Wi-Fi driver is required to perform detection and negotiation of proper Wi-Fi Power Save Mode (PSM) between the device and the Wi-Fi Access Point and report it as AutoPowerSaveMode in the WDI\_STATION\_ATTRIBUTES.  If the driver reports that it supports PSM detection, WLAN service will delegate the PSM decision to the driver by default.

If the driver supports the AUTO-PSM capability the Wi-Fi service will no longer set the broadcast management filter to receive beacons from the miniport and will instead set an OID to turn on Auto-PSM in the driver.  When in Auto-PSM, the driver should always negotiate PSM mode when it detects that the AP supports it and manage the use of PSM between the device and the Wi-Fi Access Point to ensure optimal connectivity while using the least amount of power.

**Connection Loss **

All WLAN devices must detect and indicate the loss of the connected AP (no beacons) within 20 beacon intervals.

**Permit Information Elements to be added to Association Frames (Request/Response)**

All 802.11 devices must permit Information Elements to be added to association frames, both requests and responses. This includes adding currently specified Information Elements, such as Wi-Fi Protected Setup as well as other vendor extended Information Elements.

**Transmit Packets on Any Boundary**

Buffer alignment refers to whether a buffer begins on an odd-byte, word, double-word, or other boundary. Devices must be able to transmit packets with any of the packets fragments beginning on an odd-byte boundary. For performance reasons, packets must be received into contiguous buffers on a double-word boundary.

**TCP Checksum Offload (If-Implemented) (WDI drivers only)**

TCP/IP protocol is designed to provide a reliable data transfer mechanism. This calls for the TCP stack to implement various protection mechanisms to detect and fix such errors. One such mechanism is the concept of using "checksums" to ensure reliability. In Windows we do the checksum computations in the OS, request retries of packets and manage the packets within the HOST. The WLAN Device must report that it supports offloads and be able to offload in the OS-prescribed manner. Device must be able to detect if the offload is causing performance issues and be able to disable the offload. Offloads should work across Station Connectivity and Wi-Fi Direct usage scenarios.

**Connectivity Types**

All WLAN devices must be able to connect using the following Wi-Fi connection types. All WLAN devices declare support for these through WDI\_ALGO\_PAIRS reported in OID\_WDI\_GET\_ADAPTER\_CAPABILITIES

Authentication and cipher support required in infrastructure mode:

802.11ac/g/n

| Authnetication  | Cipher     |
|-----------------|------------|
| Open            | None       |
| Open            | WEP-40bit  |
| Open            | WEP-104bit |
| Open            | WEP        |
| WPA-Enterprise  | TKIP       |
| WPA-Enterprise  | CCMP       |
| WPA-Personal    | TKIP       |
| WPA-Personal    | CCMP       |
| WPA2-Enterprise | TKIP       |
| WPA2-Enterprise | CCMP       |
| WPA2-Personal   | TKIP       |
| WPA2-Personal   | CCMP       |

**For 802.11ad** the following types auth/ciphers must be supported

| Authnetication | Cipher     |
|----------------|------------|
| Open           | None       |
| WPA2-Enterprise| GCMP       |
| WPA2-Personal  | GCMP       |

\[Native Wi-Fi Drivers Only\] (If-Implemented) Authentication and cipher support required in ad-hoc (IBSS) mode:

| Authnetication | Cipher     |
|----------------|------------|
| Open           | None       |
| Open           | WEP-40bit  |
| Open           | WEP-104bit |
| Open           | WEP        |
| WPA2-Personal  | CCMP       |

**Support Hibernate and Resume **

If the device supports Hibernate and Resume, the device should not fall off the bus as part of its initial (boot time) firmware download process or while going to hibernate state.

**Support Radio Management (Radio On/Off)**

Device must support Radio Management requests from the OS via the WDI\_TASK\_SET\_RADIO\_STATE command. Please refer to the WDI spec for more information.

**Support Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)**

Devices must support Wi-Fi Protected Setup. OS will issue WDI\_SET\_P2P\_WPS\_ENABLED command to indicate to the LE when WPS is set. Please refer to the WDI Spec for more information.

**Support Packet Filters (If-Implemented)**

Packet Filters allow the OS to filter different types of packets when upon receipt. The OS uses the WDI\_TLV\_PACKET\_FILTER\_PARAMETERS TLV to indicate which type of packet to filter for. Please refer to the WDI spec for more information.

**Obtain WFA Certifications (if-Implemented)**

It is strongly recommended that devices obtain the following WFA Certifications:

-   802.11n
-   WMM
-   WPA2Protected Management Frames (PMF)

**Support Hang Detection and Recovery (If-Implemented) (WDI drivers only)**

Wi-Fi device firmware has been known to hang and / or get in a stuck state. Once that happens, the Lower Edge driver would either crash causing a 9F (Blue Screen) or the Wi-Fi subsystem gets into a state which requires a system reboot for the device to be functional again. In either case, the user is faced with a negative experience in their connectivity and their general system usage is disrupted. As an integral part of WDI, we have designed a mechanism to detect when the firmware gets into these states and recover the device seamlessly. This will ensure that user will see a minimal disruption in service by ensuring that the Wi-Fi device stack recovers and resumes connectivity to the network without the system needing a reboot. Devices must report support for Hang Detection and Recovery in WDI\_GET\_ADAPTER\_CAPABILITIES. Please refer to the WDI Spec for implementation details.

Requirement – Hardware / Firmware

System ACPI firmware: The System will provide the ACPI methods to PDLR the device either at a bus or at the device level.

System hardware: The system will allow for a PDLR (full device level reset). All systems must support PDLR.

System: The System will indicate support for PDLR support.

Device: The Lower Edge driver will be able to gather dumps with 25 ms and 250 Kb size

System: The system must complete the reset within 10 seconds.

**Description**

Devices must report supported band information for each respective category. In
addition, device must comply with the following requirements.

**Roam Timing Requirement**

For devices that *do not* support Fast Roaming (this means that the STA does not
support sending/receiving action frames nor utilitizes 802.11r Fast BSS
Transitions. In addition, AP-side 802.11k Neighbor Reports and 802.11r is not
enabled in the AP): Roaming action must complete within **100ms**. This time is
measured starting when the OS issues the OID\_WDI\_TASK\_CONNECT or
OID\_WDI\_TASK\_ROAM command and ends when the
NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_ASSOCIATION\_RESULT notification is received by
the OS with the AssociationStatus set to WDI\_ASSOC\_STATUS\_SUCCESS .

For devices that *do* support Fast Roaming (this means that the STA does support
sending/receiving action frames and utilizes 802.11r Fast BSS Transitions. In
addition, AP-side 802.11k Neighbor Reports and 802.11r is enabled in the AP):
Roaming action must complete within **50ms**. This time is measured starting
when the OS issues the OID\_WDI\_TASK\_CONNECT or OID\_WDI\_TASK\_ROAM command
and ends when the NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_ASSOCIATION\_RESULT
notification is received by the OS with the AssociationStatus set to
WDI\_ASSOC\_STATUS\_SUCCESS.

**Scan Preferred Channel Sets**

Preferred channels set: When supported and permitted by the regulatory domain,
the miniport driver must prefer the following channels when scanning for
available networks or roaming to find a candidate access point:

Not Applicable for 802.11ad/60GHz/DMG Phy type

-   2.4 Ghz channels: 1 to 14

-   5GHz U-NII Low channels: 36, 40, 44, 48

-   5GHz U-NII Mid channels: 52, 56, 60,64

-   5GHz U-NII Worldwide channels: 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140

-   5GHz U-NII Upper channels: 149, 153, 157, 161,165

The driver must report support for these and any other channels it supports
through the ChannelList provided in the WDI\_BAND\_INFO of
OID\_WDI\_GET\_ADAPTER\_CAPABILITIES.

**Scan Non-Broadcast Networks**

WLAN device must be able to scan for and report the presence of non-broadcast
(i.e. Hidden) networks.

**Support Coordinated Scanning (If-Implemented) (WDI drivers only)**

VOIP Operations needs to be able to prioritize network resources such that data
quality is maintained while still allowing for mobility. As such in the wireless
stack, we have introduced the concept of Media Streaming Mode. This feature
specifically calls out the key scanning implications / behavior when in Media
Streaming Mode. Please refer to the WDI spec for more information.

**Low Latency Performance**

WLAN devices should be able to support low latency applications/scenarios such
as Wi-Fi Display/Lync/Skype. In order to do so, WLAN device must support the
following:

-   WMM should be supported on all ports including virtualized ports – ExtSTA,
    Wi-Fi Direct Role Port (Group Owner), and Wi-Fi Direct Role Port (Client).

-   WMM should be supported on Wi-Fi Direct Role Port (Group Owner) and Wi-Fi
    Direct Role Port (Client) even if the AP connected via ExSTA port does not
    support WMM.

-   The NIC should be capable of supporting prioritization across two ports
    (ExtSTA & one Wi-Fi Direct Role Port) at the same time.

-   Devices should be able to prioritize traffic based on 802.11e Access
    Category (AC) tagging.

-   When the NIC is virtualized with Concurrency in single channel, it should be
    able to prioritize transmit traffic across different virtual ports based on
    WMM & Media Streaming indication.

-   When the NIC is virtualized with Concurrency across multiple channels, it
    should be able to prioritize transmit traffic across different virtual ports
    based on WMM and Media Streaming Indication and receiving traffic is
    serviced across the concurrent channels.

When WMM prioritization is used with AC\_VI or AC\_VO (Voice/Video), WLAN device
must meet the following latency and packet loss requirements.

|                                                    | ExSTA         | Wi-Fi Direct Role Port | Max. One Way Latency at UDP for AC\_VI/AC\_VO Traffic | Packet Loss for AC\_VI/AC\_VO Traffic      |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ExSTA Only                                         | AC\_VI/AC\_VO | NA                     | 30ms                                                  | 0.5%, not more that 3 consequetive packets |
|                                                    |               |                        |                                                       |                                            |
| ExSTA + Wi-Fi Direct in Single Channel Concurrency | AC\_VI/AC\_VO |                        | 30ms                                                  | 0.5%, not more that 3 consequetive packets |
|                                                    |               | AC\_VI/AC\_VO          | 30ms                                                  | 0.5%, not more that 3 consequetive packets |

|                                                    |               |                        |                                                       |                                            |
| ExSTA + Wi-Fi Direct in Multi Channel Concurrency  | AC\_VI/AC\_VO |                        | 40ms                                                  | 0.5%, not more that 3 consequetive packets |
|                                                    |               | AC\_VI/AC\_VO          | 40ms                                                  | 0.5%, not more that 3 consequetive packets |
|                                                    | AC\_VI/AC\_VO | AC\_VI/AC\_VO          | 50ms                                                  | 0.5%, not more that 3 consequetive packets |

**Minimum Throughput Performance**

**Throughput With Concurrent Operation:** The 802.11 devices must not have more
than 20% aggregate throughput degradation when data flow is divided among 3
ports (with and without Multi-Channel/Band operation) namely – ExtSTA, Wi-Fi
Direct Role Port (GO) and Wi-Fi Direct Role Port (Client) compared with
aggregate throughput when only one Wi-Fi port is connected.

**Throughput:**

This requirement for throughput is applicable to all types of ports (ExtSTA,
Wi-Fi Direct Role Port (GO) and Wi-Fi Direct Role Port (Client)) individually.

Device must be capable of supporting the following throughput numbers over a TCP
connection for a particular combination of Phy type, number of streams and
channel width. Throughput is measured at the application layer using CTS perf
measurement tool built into Windows hardware certification kit.

(<http://ctstraffic.codeplex.com/> )

-   If WLAN device supports 802.11ac Phy Type (Note that 802.11ac Phy Type
    support is optional for WLAN devices. 802.11ac devices will also be tested
    for 802.11n operations)

    -   802.11ac combinations will be tested on 5 Ghz band only.

    -   Both transmit and receive side throughput will be tested. Device is
        expected to meet same throughput number (listed below) for a particular
        combination on both transmission and reception side.

Max supported spatial stream by the NIC will be tested. E.g., if the NIC
supports 3 spatial streams, combinations with spatial stream 3 will be tested.

| *Channel Width*          | *20 Mhz*              | *40 Mhz*                                       | *80 Mhz*              |                                                |                       |                                                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|

Support Advanced WMM Levels across WFD Role Ports

**Description**

This requirements captures the work needed to be done by the Wi-Fi Driver. This includes support for concurrent operation over Miracast, Station & Bluetooth.

**Details**

The Connection Quality & Performance of Wi-Fi Direct is essential to the Miracast Scenario. The assessment for the Device/Driver will provide the results for your device, below is guidance for a reasonable quality Miracast Connection.  

WMM shall be supported on all ports including virtualized ports – ExtSTA, Wi-Fi Direct Role Port (Group Owner), and Wi-Fi Direct Role Port (Client).

-   The NIC should be capable of supporting prioritization across two ports (ExtSTA & one Wi-Fi Direct Role Port) at the same time.

-   Prioritize traffic based on 802.11e Access Category (AC) tagging.

-   When the NIC is virtualized with Concurrency in single channel, it must be able to prioritize transmit traffic across different virtual ports based on WMM & Media Streaming indication.

-   When the NIC is virtualized with Concurrency across multiple channels, it must be able to prioritize transmit traffic across different virtual ports based on WMM and Media Streaming Indication and receiving traffic is serviced across the concurrent channels.

When WMM prioritization is used with AC\_VI or AC\_VO (Voice/Video), WLAN device should meet the following latency and packet loss requirements.
