## Device.Input.Location

*Windows 10 location drivers can implement either of the following driver models.*

-   GNSS drivers integrating with the legacy sensor class extension driver

*OR*

-   GNSS driver integrating with the GNSS DDI introduced in Windows 10

### Device.Input.Location.ActiveTracking

*Active tracking breadcrumbing*

**Terms: If-Implemented**

**Description**

This requirement allows a GNSS chip to actively track a user’s location based on breadcrumbing technology. The OS will offload breadcrumbing to the hardware and receive user location when needed. This features enables the OS to gather a user’s location history in a more granular manner.

### Device.Input.Location.AssistedGNSS

*Only relevant if the hardware uses the location stack for Assisted GNSS of the given type.*

**Terms: If-Implemented**

**Description**

Assistance to the GNSS receiver is used to enable the receiver to acquire a position faster, to enable acquisition even in cases of very weak signal, and do so at lower power. The Location platform supports providing the GNSS device with a coarse position, approximate time, and it can also serve as a proxy of the proprietary ephemeris formats supported by the GNSS device.

### Device.Input.Location.Base

*Location devices must support the following basic functionality.*

</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Location devices must be able to interact correctly with the platform to receive location requests and provide a response with a position or an error. The exchange of capabilities must supported, as well as the configuration commands, for whichever functionality is present and mandatory in the driver interface. All location devices need to ensure that they report location data at an interval determined by the type of location session and the location session parameters. The application desired accuracy and other session parameters should be considered to provide location data as efficiently as possible.

As two driver models are supported, we have requirements specific requirements and tests for each.

***For GNSS drivers integrating with the legacy sensor class extension driver ***

The GNSS device must support the following basic requirements:

        <p>- The Location API exposes location data through standard built-in reports. These reports are populated from location sensors that the Location API manages automatically.</p>
        <p>- Location sensor devices that report their category as SENSOR_CATEGORY_LOCATION (though Device Driver Interfaces ISensorDriver::OnGetSupportedSensorObjects and IsensorDriver::OnGetProperties()) must support one of the built-in reports so that the location API can manage the sensor and report its data. Each built-in report has a set of expected data fields (though Device Driver Interface IsensorDriver::OnGetSupportedDataFields() and IsensorDriver::OnGetDataFields()) that the Location API looks for.</p>
        <p>- All built-in reports require SENSOR_DATA_TYPE_TIMESTAMP to be provided in addition to the designated fields. This field reports the time the data was collected in UTC.</p>
        <p>- The Location API supports a built-in report: the LatLongReport, which requires in the response measurements for the Latitude/Longitude (lat/long) and an Error.  Support for the LatLongReport is required for all location sensors.</p>
        <p>To support LatLongReport, the following fields are required:</p>

**Terms: If-Implemented**

**Description**

This requirement allows the GPS to define geographical boundaries or virtual barriers. It allows an administrator of a mobile device to trigger actions or notifications when a device enters or leaves the geofence. Practical uses include the ability for a retail store owner to create a geofence around the retail store and send coupons to a customer with the retail store app on his/her mobile device.

If implemented, the device must be able to support the following requirements.

| **Geofence basic **    | GeoFence can be successfully added and deleted. Must check for consistency.                                                                                                                     |

| **Geofence track 4**   | Add a Geofence with EXITED state such that your current position is just outside the Geofence. Verify no event is triggered.                                                                    |
| **Geofence track 5**   | Add a Geofence around your current position with UNKNOWN state and Alert Type as EXIT only and verify that no event is recieved                                                                 |

| **Reliability**        | Obtains the maximum number of geofences that the hardware supports. Set this maximum number of Geofences around current position with unknow state and expect that number of entry/exit events. |
| **Geofence purge **    | Add multiple Geofences and then purge them all at once. Must check for consistency.                                                                                                             |

**Terms: If-Implemented**

**Description**

The Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) client must be implemented by the IHV to support Mobile Operator requirements. The driver interface provides mechanisms to configure the SUPL client, with the information obtained for the Mobile Operator. The only SUPL configurations supported by the Location Platform are those associated to a Mobile Operator, and only one SUPL configuration is supported at a time.

The tests in this section ensures that the SUPL client is able to receive SUPL configuration commands from the Location Platform. There are no tests in the HLK to validate the integration between the GNSS driver and the Location Platform for the support of user notifications upon reception of NI (Network Initiated) location requests. Such validations will need to be done using dedicated systems and test suites that validate SUPL OMA conformance.
