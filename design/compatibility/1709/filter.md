**Description**

Windows 10 has a feature called [*Device Guard*](http://blogs.windows.com/business/2015/04/21/windows-10-security-innovations-at-rsa-device-guard-windows-hello-and-microsoft-passport/) that gives organizations the ability to lock down devices in a way that provides advanced malware protection against new and unknown malware variants as well as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Device Guard can use hardware technology and virtualization to isolate the Code Integrity (CI) decision-making function from the rest of the Windows operating system. When using virtualization-based security to isolate Code Integrity, the only way kernel memory can become executable is through a Code Integrity verification. This means that kernel memory pages can never be Writable and Executable (W+X) and executable code cannot be directly modified.

Details are available on the Windows Hardware Certification Blog: [Driver compatibility with Device Guard in Windows 10](http://aka.ms/DeviceGuard).

The following attributes must be set on the sys file.
<table>
<tr><th>Name of attribute</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>CompanyName</td><td>Company name</td></tr>
<tr><td>FileDescription</td><td>File/Product description of the driver</td></tr>
<tr><td>OriginalFilename</td><td>Original file name</td></tr>

</table>

You can find more details on the following MSDN page:

-   <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa381058.aspx>

All kernel drivers on Windows MUST be signed by Microsoft (WHQL certificate) through the SysDev dashboard.

## Filter.Driver.EarlyLaunchAntiMalware 

*This section describes requirements for early launch driver.*

### Filter.Driver.EarlyLaunchAntiMalware.BackupDriver

*Early launch anti-malware drivers must include a backup copy in case of corruption.*

<table>
<tr>
<td>Applies to</td>
<td>
<p>Windows 10 Client x64</p>
<p>Windows 10 Client x86</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>


**Description**

The anti-malware (AM) driver is critical to the boot success of the computer.  If the driver gets corrupted, then the boot may not succeed.  To provide the best user experience, it is required that when the AM driver is installed, it also installs a copy in the driver backup store.  This ensures a smooth remediation experience in the case that the primary driver gets corrupted.

The location of the ELAM backup store is defined by Windows, and stored in the registry:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\EarlyLaunch ! BackupPath

*Design Notes:*
The early launch anti-malware (AM) drivers are started soon after the NTOS kernel starts.  For each subsequent boot driver, the AM driver receives a callback from the PnP manager to determine whether the boot driver should be initialized.  The AM driver evaluates the boot driver and must return good, bad, or unknown.  Based on the returned classification and defined policy, the PnP manager decides whether to initialize the boot driver.

### Filter.Driver.EarlyLaunchAntiMalware.ELAMSignatureAttributes

*Requirement for the SignatureAttribute section in the ELAM INF files.*

<table>
<tr>
<td>Applies to</td>
<td>
<p>Windows 10 Client x64</p>
<p>Windows 10 Client x86</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>


**Description**

ELAM files must be signed with a special signature as part of the submission process. The process of determining what signature each module needs is being standardized; each INF file must now include a SignatureAttributes section that uniquely identifies what type of signature is applicable for the associated driver binaries. Adding this section to existing inf files is a very simple process.

An example follows.
```
\[SignatureAttributes\]
ELAMFILE.dll = SignatureAttributes.Elam
\[SignatureAttributes.Elam\]
Elam=true
```

### Filter.Driver.EarlyLaunchAntiMalware.MVIMembership

*Early launch anti-malware drivers may only be created by MVI members.*

<table>
<tr>
<td>Applies to</td>
<td>

<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>


**Description**

Any early launch anti-malware (AM) driver may only be created by Microsoft Virus Initiative (MVI) members.

 *Design Notes:*
The early launch AM drivers are started soon after the NTOS kernel starts.  For each subsequent boot driver, the AM driver receives a callback from the PnP manager to determine whether the boot driver should be initialized.  The AM driver evaluates the boot driver and must return good, bad, or unknown.  Based on the returned classification and defined policy, the PnP manager decides whether to initialize the boot driver.

### Filter.Driver.EarlyLaunchAntiMalware.Performance

*Early launch anti-malware drivers must be performant.*

<table>
<tr>
<td>Applies to</td>

<p>Windows 10 Client x64</p>
<p>Windows 10 Client x86</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>


**Description**

Callback Latency:
The anti-malware (AM) driver is required to return a result for each callback within 0.5 ms of receiving the callback.

Memory Allocation:
The AM driver, including both the driver image as well as its configuration (signature) data, is required to have a limited memory footprint of 256 KB or less.

Unload Blocking:
Each AM driver will receive a synchronous callback after the last boot driver has been initialized indicating that the AM driver will be unloaded. At this point, the AM driver must clean up and save any persistent status information. This must occur within 0.5 ms as measured from the time when the kernel issues the callback to the driver to the time that the AM driver returns the callback.

*Design Notes:*
The early launch AM drivers are started soon after the NTOS kernel starts.  For each subsequent boot driver, the AM driver receives a callback from the PnP manager to determine whether the boot driver should be initialized.  The AM driver evaluates the boot driver and must return good, bad, or unknown.  Based on the returned classification and defined policy, the PnP manager decides whether to initialize the boot driver. 

### Filter.Driver.EarlyLaunchAntiMalware.SignatureData

*Early launch anti-malware drivers must only use signature data stored in the Microsoft-specific location.*

<table>
<tr>
<td>Applies to</td>
<td>
<p>Windows 10 Client x64</p>

<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>


**Description**

The AM driver must get its malware signature data from a single, well-known location and no other.  The signature data shall be stored in the registry in a new ELAM hive under HKLM that is loaded by Winload, and will therefore be available to the AM driver prior to the file system being initialized.   Each AM driver will have a unique key in which to store their signature blob.   The registry path and key shall be of the format HKLM\\ELAM\\<*Vendor Name*>\\Measured : Binary = <*blob*>.

*Design Notes:*
The early launch anti-malware (AM) drivers are started soon after the NTOS kernel starts.  For each subsequent boot driver, the AM driver receives a callback from the PnP manager to determine whether the boot driver should be initialized.  The AM driver evaluates the boot driver and must return good, bad, or unknown.  Based on the returned classification and defined policy, the PnP manager decides whether to initialize the boot driver.

This is to ensure that host firewalls do not leave unused objects upon uninstall, thereby potentially causing diagnostic issues if another separate host firewall is installed on the same PC. 
The following WFP objects need to be cleaned up: Provider, providerContext, Filter, subLayer, or callout.
In addition, additional installation requirements for applications (via the Software logo program) must be met.

*Design Notes*:

Applications can use either an MSI, or another installer that meets this requirement to ensure a satisfactory install/uninstall experience on a Windows® based PC.

**Description**

The Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) includes a Network Diagnostics Framework (NDF) helper class, called the Filtering Platform helper class (FPHC). FPHC can help to identify the root causes of connectivity issues caused by WFP. A host firewall can invoke its own NDF helper class. FPHC extensibility allows these third-party helper classes to be invoked during diagnostics.

FPHC can identify WFP as the cause of a connectivity issue. If available, FPHC can also identify the provider that created the filter that is blocking network traffic. FPHC passes this information to NDF, which in turn can then notify the user that WFP is causing the connectivity problem and give the name of the provider blocking traffic.

However, the FPHC cannot suggest a corrective action to the user, nor can it provide the reason that the filter is blocking traffic to the user. Only an FPHC extension can perform those tasks.

Host firewalls must be able to successfully diagnose the inbound/outbound connection failures caused by the host firewall, and provide an appropriate response to the end-user based on the diagnosis. (for example, repair mechanism, message explaining to the user the reason why the connection failed, and so on).

*Design Notes:*
More information regarding NDF and FPHC can be found in the following links:

NDF       : <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=125463&clcid=0x409><br/>

</td></tr></table>


**Description**

Firewalls may use callouts to modify and re-inject network packets, when filtering at any layer. One or many host firewalls may be present on the same system. When there is only one host firewall is present on the system, continually modifying & re-injecting the same packets may result in reduced performance and is to be avoided. When multiple host firewalls (with callouts) are present on the system, the same network packet(s) may continually be modified by multiple callouts. When a host firewall continually modifies and reinjects the same packet, it may result in the network packet never getting processed and could potentially create a deadlock, which is to be avoided.

Host firewalls must not modify and reinject the same network packet more than 2 times per layer. If such a situation occurs, host firewalls may choose to let the packet go through, or drop the network packet.

**Description**

Host firewalls are provided with the ability to selectively turn parts of Windows Firewall on or off. These parts specify different types of rules (and subsequently filter sets), and may also be referred to as categories. Filter sets that may be selectively turned off are Boot-Time Filters, Firewall Filters, Connection Security Filters, and Stealth Filters.
The 'Register' interface is supported by the HNetCfg.FwProducts COM object. The put\_DisplayName() call must be used to fill in your product information.
Before turning off the firewall rules category, vendor firewalls must ensure that all filters must be installed.

This requirement ensures better interoperability with Windows. In addition, if all installed host firewalls on the system are uninstalled for any reason, Windows Firewall is aware of this, and will automatically turn on the firewall filters, ensuring that the system is always protected.
The Connection Security filters need to remain enabled to keep Windows scenarios protected. Specifically, the Connection Security filters ensure that the system supports communications that require authentication and encryption.

*Design Notes*:

This requirement ensures that firewall vendors disable Windows Firewall per documented guidelines.

**Description**

Host firewalls must not circumvent the intent of the Windows Filtering Platform API tests, by simply maintaining all 'permit\_all' filters for all kinds of network traffic, which essentially is not meaningful filtering of network traffic. This applies to both, static as well as callout filters. Similarly, Host firewalls must not maintain only 'block\_all' filters. However, that will be addressed when testing for consumer scenarios.

**Description**

In addition to supporting scenarios based on applications within Windows® it is important to support applications (installed by the home user), that are registered with the host firewall for filtering purposes. Firewalls may use parameters, such as path and ports, as the basis for permitting or blocking application-specific traffic. This scenario will need to work with native IPv4, native IPv6, 6to4, and Teredo packets.
The word *support* refers to the *host firewall's capability* to ensure exceptions from applications work with the host firewall, if the application/user/network needs it. The host firewall must also have properly configured objects, such as filters, to support the required functionality, even though the functionality may not be enabled by default in the UI.

**Description**

Teredo may be used as a connectivity mechanism to support certain Windows scenarios such as remote assistance, instant messaging and others. Hence, preserving Teredo connectivity is critical to supporting Windows consumer scenarios.
For this requirement, the following must be met:

-   Host firewalls allow DNS resolution of teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com.

-   To allow client to Teredo server communication, host firewalls must allow for the system to send outbound UDP/IPv4 packets to UDP port 3544.

-   To allow Teredo connectivity, host firewalls must allow inbound and outbound UDP/IPv4 traffic over the Teredo client system ports. These ports can be obtained using the FWPMSystemPortsGet notification to determine the system port numbers used for communication using the Teredo interface.

-   Host firewalls support ICMP error messages & discovery functions (NETWORK-0250 logo requirement).

-   Host firewalls allow UPnP framework packets over UDP port 1900, and UPnP frameworkpackets over TCP port 2869.

The word *support* refers to the *host firewall's capability* to make Teredo work, if the application/user/network needs it.
