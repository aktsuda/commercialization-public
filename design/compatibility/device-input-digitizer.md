**Description**

*Applicability: “Windows Desktop”*

If a Windows Precision Touchpad digitizer utilizes a 3rd party HID mini-port driver, it shall be part of the OEM shipping image (and restore image) and available on Windows Update. Any 3rd party HID mini-port driver shall also be functional in WinPE. It is highly recommended that an inbox HID mini-port driver is utilized wherever possible for Windows Precision Touchpad implementations.

Special note: A touchpad may not be marketed as a Windows Precision Touchpad unless all the applicable compatibility requirements are met.

All Integrated Windows touch and pen devices shall be fully functional without the use of any 3rd party HID mini-port or filter drivers provided one is available for the associated bus used for connectivity. While Windows recommends that a device be shipped as tested, an OEM may elect to ship a Windows 10 compatible HID mini-port driver and/or filter driver that provides additional functionality after the device has met all associated HLK requirements including **Device.Input.Digitizer.Base.ThirdPartyDrivers** provided that all other requirements are met when that driver is installed. Any 3<sup>rd</sup> party HID mini-port driver which is used in instances where an inbox driver is not available for the bus selected for connectivity, that driver shall be part of the OEM shipping image (and restore image) and available on Windows Update. Any 3rd party HID mini-port driver shall also be functional in WinPE.

*Applicability: “Windows Mobile”*

If a Windows Precision Touchpad, integrated touch or integrated pen digitizer utilizes a 3rd party HID mini-port driver, it shall be part of the OEM Base Support Package (BSP) for the system. It is highly recommended that an inbox HID mini-port driver is utilized wherever possible.

**Business Justification**

This requirement ensures that digitizers are always available for user input regardless of servicing scenarios and or clean installations. There are instances where the digitizer may be the only source of input for a given device

|----------------|----------------------------|
| Target Feature | Device.Input.Digitizer.Pen |

**Description**

The requirement Device.Digitizer.Pen.HoverAccuracy has been merged with this requirement.

When the pen tip is in contact with the screen, the delta between actual contact location and what the device reports shall be:

-   &lt;= +/- 0.5 mm (center)

-   &lt;= +/- 1 mm (within 3.5mm of all edges)

When hovering (with tip not in contact), the physical delta between physical location and what the device reports shall be &lt;= +/- 1 mm (center).

**Business Justification**

This requirement ensures compatibility with DirectInk and inbox pen experiences; specifically:

-   When the pen is in contact with the screen ensuring that ink appears to originate from the pen tip, and ensuring ability to target small controls.

-   When the pen is hovering over the screen, ensuring that cursor position is perceived to be accurate by the user

### Device.Input.Digitizer.Pen.Buffering

<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

This is an “If-Implemented” requirement. Active pen solutions that use a bus with high resume latency such as USB with selective suspend or Bluetooth shall implement an input report buffer capable of handling &gt;= 100ms of data.

Input report buffer size (in bytes) = Input Report Size &times; (100ms/Maximum Report Rate)

While this is a requirement for devices that use a bus with high resume latency, it is recommended that solutions that use other buses also implement an input report buffer to avoid interrupt processing glitches that can occur.

**Business Justification**

Due to host controller or bus resume times from low power states, devices may need to implement buffering to ensure no user interaction data is lost during power transitions.

<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

An integrated Windows pen solution shall have a hardware affordance on the pen that provides eraser functionality compliant with the associated protocol. The erase functionality must be enabled by default.

Microsoft will allow an exception for active pens that support only a single barrel button until January 01, 2016: 

Microsoft strongly recommends that all pens support erase functionality by default.  An integrated Windows pen solution that contains support for only a single barrel button will be allowed to ship without an eraser affordance until January 1, 2016.  After January 1, 2016, an integrated Windows pen solution shall have a hardware affordance on the pen that provides eraser functionality compliant with the associated protocol and the erase functionality must be enabled by default.

**Business Justification**

This requirement ensures that interactions with the pen are intuitive and efficient. This implementation enables software developers to develop for eraser functionality while remaining agnostic to the eraser implementation.

Note:  Active pens that enable eraser functionality provide the most natural means to erase digital ink.  Active pens that enable eraser functionality also free the application developer from having to develop UI to switch pen context from ink mode to erase mode.  Therefore it is strongly recommended that all pens support erase functionality by default.

**Description**

Reported jitter from an integrated Windows pen shall be:

-   Moving Jitter

    -   &lt;= +/- 0.4 mm (center)

    -   &lt;= +/- 0.6 mm (within 3.5mm of all edges)

-   Stationary Jitter

    -   &lt;= +/- 0.3 mm (center)

    -   &lt;= +/- 0.5 mm (within 3.5mm of all edges)

-   Hover Stationary Jitter &lt;= +/- 0.5mm (center)

**Business Justification**

This requirement ensures compatibility with DirectInk and more specifically:

-   When the pen tip is in contact with the screen and moving, ink accurately reflects actual pen strokes of the user

-   When the pen is held stationary (either when in contact with the screen or hovering), jitter is not perceivable to the user.

</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Pen digitizers shall have response latencies per the following:

-   Cold Boot Latency

    -   An integrated Windows pen shall be immediately responsive once the display is active

    -   Cold Boot is defined as the period from application of power to the controller until the controller is ready to accept HID commands

-   Down Latency (Idle) &lt;= 150ms (If-Implemented)

    -   This requirement is applicable if an idle power state has been implemented

    -   Down latency (Idle) is defined as the delay between the pen making initial contact with the screen when the device is in an idle power state and having the associated report delivered to the host.

-   Down Latency (Active) &lt;= 35ms (center)

    -   Down latency (Active) is defined as the delay between the pen making initial contact with the screen when the device is in an active power state and having the associated report delivered to the host.

-   Move Latency &lt;= 30ms (center)

    -   While a pen tip is in motion (and in contact with the screen), move latency is defined as the delay between the pen being at a physical location and having the associated report delivered to the host

**Business Justification**

This requirement ensures:

-   Devices are readily available for user interactions after a system power state transition.

-   When pen makes initial contact with the screen, lag in visual feedback is not perceivable to most users.

-   When pen is in contact with the screen and moving, end-to-end latency of inking and other interactions are not perceivable to most users.

**Description**

The following requirements have been merged into this requirement:

-   Device.Input.PrecisionTouchpad.Performance.ActiveTouchdownLatency

-   Device.Input.PrecisionTouchpad.Performance.IdleTouchdownLatency

-   Device.Input.PrecisionTouchpad.Performance.PanLatency

Touch down Latency:

-   Active:

    -   Windows precision touchpads shall have &lt;= 35 ms touch down latency in the active state. Touch down latency is defined as the time between contact with the digitizer and the subsequent input report being received by the host.

-   Idle:

    -   Windows precision touchpads shall have &lt;= 150 ms touch down latency in the idle state.

    -   Touch down latency is defined as the time between contact with the digitizer and the subsequent input report being received by the host.

Move Latency:

-    Windows precision touchpads shall have panning latency &lt;= 70 ms. Panning latency is defined as the period between the movement on the digitizer and the subsequent change being received by the host.

Cold boot Latency:

-    Windows precision touchpads shall be immediately responsive once the display is active on systems emerging from cold boot. Cold boot is defined as the period from application of power to the controller until the controller is ready to accept HID commands.

**Business Justification**

This requirement ensures that core user experiences involving taps, moussing, and gesturing are still performant (i.e., tapping a button, control, hyperlink, etc.).

The touchpad device should be readily available for user input once the system has booted or resumed from a low power state irrespective of its bus connectivity.

Additional UX study on the impact of panning latency for indirect input devices justifies increased panning latency compared to direct input devices.

</td></tr></table>

**Description**

This is an “If-Implemented” requirement. A Windows touch solution connected over USB or Bluetooth shall implement an input report buffer capable of handling &gt;= 100ms of data based upon the maximum number of contacts supported by the device

Input report buffer size (in bytes) (for Single Finger Hybrid Reporting): = Maximum \# of Contacts Supported &times; Input Report Size &times; (100ms/Maximum Report Rate)

While this is a requirement for devices that use a bus with high resume latency, it is recommended that solutions that use other buses also implement an input report buffer to avoid interrupt processing glitches that can occur.

**Business Justification**

Due to host controller or bus resume times from low power states, devices may need to implement buffering to ensure no user interaction data is lost during power transitions.
