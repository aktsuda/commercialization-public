**Description**

When turning the radio “off”, Bluetooth controllers shall be powered down to its lowest supported power state and no transmission/reception shall take place. Windows will terminate Bluetooth activity by unloading the inbox protocol drivers and their children, submitting the HCI\_Reset command to the controller, and then setting the controller to the D3 logical power state, allowing bus drivers to power down the radio as appropriate. The radio can be completely powered off if a bus-supported method is available to turn the radio back on. No additional vendor software control components will be supported.

On turning the radio back on, the Windows Bluetooth stack shall resume the device to D0, allowing bus drivers to restart the device. The Windows Bluetooth stack shall then reinitialize the Bluetooth components of the controller.

Bluetooth Radio Management in Windows 8.1 shall only be enabled for internal Bluetooth 4.0 controllers.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Applies to</th>
<td>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Wideband speech enables high definition voice quality (audio is sampled at 16 KHz as opposed to only 8 KHz) for telephony audio on Windows devices when the user is communicating via a Bluetooth peripheral that also supports wideband speech.

What this means is that Bluetooth radios must support wideband speech in the hardware as defined by the Bluetooth SIG [Hands-Free Profile (HFP) 1.6 specification](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=238193) and the [Core Specification Addendum (CSA) 2](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=245127) which is included in the [Core Version 4.1](https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=282159) Bluetooth specification. At a minimum it must use at least one Bluetooth SIG defined wideband speech codec (currently mSBC).

**Business Justification:**

We want users to experience the best possible quality audio when using Bluetooth peripherals on Windows. Wideband speech is becoming a standard for peripherals that support the HFP profile. Our competition already supports it
