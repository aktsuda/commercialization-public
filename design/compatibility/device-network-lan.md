### Device.Network.LAN.AzureStack.CloudStress

_Network controllers that are used for Microsoft Azure Stack solutions must comply with this specification_ 

<table><tr><th>Applies to</th><td><p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p></td></tr></table>

**Description**

Private cloud solutions comprise of tightly integrated software and hardware components to deliver resiliency with high performance. Issues in any of the components (software, hardware, drivers, firmware, and so forth) can compromise the solution and undermine any promises made regarding the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the private cloud. 

Many of these issues are surfaced only under a high-stress, private cloud simulation. The Private Cloud Simulator (PCS) enables you to validate your component in a cloud scenario and identify such issues. It simulates a live datacenter/private cloud by creating VM workloads, scheduling administrative operations (load balancing, software/hardware maintenance), and injecting faults (unplanned hardware/software failures) on the private cloud. 

To comply with this specification, the controller must pass the PCS test run with the ‘Network Controller – AzureStack’ profile on a 4-node clustered configuration.

</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Ethernet devices Miniport Driver/Driver Software must not disable OS services. Some devices tend to shutoff services such as the Base Filtering Engine (BFE). This leaves the system vulnerable to attack due to lack of security capabilities.

### Device.Network.LAN.Base.PriorityVLAN

*Ethernet devices that implement link speeds of gigabit or greater must implement Priority & VLAN tagging according to the IEEE 802.1q specification.*

<table>
<tr>
<th>Applies to</th>
<td>

<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Padding that is added to short Ethernet packets to bring that packet size to the minimum IEEE 802.3, Section 4.2.3.3, packet size must be initialized to either zeros or an 8-bit repeating pattern before the packets are transmitted. The 802.3 Ethernet specification requires packets that are shorter than the minimum packet size to be padded up to the minimum size before the packets are transmitted onto the wire. The 802.3 Ethernet specification does not specify the padding content; however, Microsoft requires the padding to be zeros or another constant value to address security concerns. Some drivers pad the packets with data from previously sent packets; this practice is not acceptable. 

Design Notes: New solutions are recommended to implement a padding of zeros. However, some devices that implement the padding in hardware use 0xffs, which addresses the security concern.

### Device.Network.LAN.Base.SupportIEEEE8023

## Device.Network.LAN.CS

*A connected standby capable computer (also known as a platform) supports a low power active state, and advertises support of that state to the OS using the appropriate ACPI flag (LOW\_POWER\_S0\_IDLE\_CAPABLE) in FADT. It is also expected to meet all the Windows certification requirements for a connected standby platform. This section specifies the connected standby requirements for Wired LAN (Ethernet).*

### Device.Network.LAN.CS.NetworkWake

*Wired LAN (Ethernet) devices integrated into Connected Standby systems or docks shipped with the system must support network wake patterns.*

<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

The specific requirements are listed below:

Wake on LAN Patterns:

Wired LAN devices and their drivers are required support at least thirty-two (32) bitmap patterns of a minimum of 128-byte size. This pattern type refers to flexible bitmap patterns (NDIS\_PM\_WOL\_PACKET.NdisPMWoLPacketBitmapPattern) and not other pattern types.

Wake on Magic Packet:

Wired LAN devices and their drivers must support magic packet wake. Support for this wake packet type is required and is not included in the 32-bitmap pattern requirement.

Wake Packet Indication:

Wired LAN devices and their drivers are required to support Wake Packet Indication for all network wake packets and be capable of caching and indicating the complete network packet causing the wake. Note that this supersedes the Device.Network.LAN.PM.WakePacket requirement for Connected Standby-capable devices.

Design Notes:

See the Power Management specification on MSDN.

### Device.Network.LAN.CS.PresenceOffload

*Wired LAN (Ethernet) devices integrated into Connected Standby systems or docks shipped with the system must support network presence offload.*

<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

Support of this feature is required. The specific requirements are listed below:

ARP Protocol Offload:

Wired LAN devices must implement ARP offload as it is defined in the Power Management specification on MSDN. Specifically, the offload must respond to an ARP Request (operation = 1) by responding with an ARP Reply (operation = 2) as defined in RFC 826 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826>).

NS Protocol Offload:

Wired LAN devices must implement IPv6 NS offload as it is defined in Power Management specification on MSDN. Specifically, the offload must respond to a Neighbor Solicitation (operation = 135) by responding with an NS Advertisement (operation = 136) as defined in RFC 4861 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861>). We require support for at least 2 ND offload requests. Each request can have 2 target addresses. The value they should advertise in NDIS\_PM\_CAPABILITIES::NumNSOffloadIPv6Addresses is the NUMBER OF REQUESTS, not number of addresses. So, if they support the minimum 2 requests, they should advertise 2. The name of the field is wrong and will be fixed in the next NDIS release.

The miniport must implement the said protocol in accordance to RFCs describing Neighbor Discovery and Neighbor Solicitation Protocol for IPv6.

### Device.Network.LAN.CS.ReliableCSConnectivity

*LAN device on systems that support Connected Standby must deliver reliable connectivity in Connected Standby.*

<table>
<tr>
<th>Applies to</th>
<td>
<p>Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) x64</p>

<p>Windows 10 Mobile ARM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Mobile x86</p>
<p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p>
</td></tr></table>

**Description**

The wired LAN device seamlessly transitions between working power state D0 and low power state D2/D3 while in Connected Standby (CS). The wired LAN device maintains OSI layer 2 link connectivity while in CS. The wired LAN device wakes up on matching wake patterns only. There are no spurious wakes while in CS. Wake packets are delivered without delay or buffering. Lock screen apps stay connected with Control Channel or Push Notification triggers over IPv4 and IPv6 in CS.

The exact D-value in low power state depends on the underlying bus type. For example, network adapters on USB, or SDIO buses use D2 as their low power state, while network adapters on PCI or PCIe buses use the D3 state.

**Description**

This requirement only applies to Ethernet devices that implement the Network Direct Kernel Mode Interface (NDKPI) Specification. Devices that implement Network Direct Kernel Mode Interface (NDKPI) (a.k.a., Kernel-mode RDMA) must comply with the Network Direct Kernel Mode Interface (NDKPI) Specification. Version 2.0 has been the current specification since July 2014.  Submissions complying with Version 1.2 of the NDKPI Specification will be accepted until December 31, 2016, but will be unable to work with the hyper-converged scenarios in Windows Server 2016.  Effective January 1, 2017, only NDKPI version 2.0 compliant devices will be accepted.  Submissions for the Microsoft Azure Stack (MAS) AQ LOGO not AQ must support NDKPI Version 2.0.

NDKPI version 2.0 describes three modes of operation:

- Mode 1, a mode that supports native mode operation
- Mode 2, a mode that supports NDKPI on NIC_Switch vPorts 
- Mode 3, a mode that supports NDKPI exposed on a VF driver

Windows 10 Client drivers are only required to support Mode 1.

Windows Server 2016 and MAS drivers must support Modes 1 and 2.

**Description**

Ethernet devices must support Jumbo Frames, and the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) values in the User Interface must include the Ethernet header size of 14 Bytes. The “\*JumboPacket” standardized keyword in the Windows Registry is currently used for setting the MTU size and should remain as an enumerable value with supported values being 1514, 4088, and 9014.

### Device.Network.LAN.MTUSize.EncapOverhead

<table><tr><th>Applies to</th><td><p>Windows Server 2016 x64</p></td></tr></table>

**Description**

A new keyword will be added called “*EncapOverhead” with type being numeric, default value of 0, max value of 256, and step increments of size 32. This value will account for overhead in Ethernet frames due to virtual network overlay encapsulation such as VXLAN and NVGRE. MTU size will therefore be determined by the summation of these two keyword values except perhaps in the case where *JumboPacket + *EncapOverhead would exceed some hardware upper bound of the NIC.

Devices implementing GRE or VxLAN offloads must also incorporate this requirement.

Message Signaled Interrupts Extended (MSI-X) as defined in the PCI v3.0 specification. For devices with a link speed of less than 10 gigabit, the device must have 1 MSI-X vector with support for 2 RSS hardware queues. For devices 10 gigabit or greater, the device must have an MSI-X vector for each RSS hardware queue. For example, if the device has a link speed of 10 gigabits and advertises support for 8 RSS hardware queues then it must have at least 8 MSI-X vectors in the hardware.

*Design Notes*

See RSS Standardized Keywords Specification <http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570864.aspx>.

In addition, the device must allocate as many MSI-X table entries as there are CPUs in the system. See the NDIS documentation section on MSI-X for more details <http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566491.aspx>.

**Description**

This requirement only applies to Ethernet devices that implement RSS. If the Ethernet device does not implement RSS, then this requirement does not apply. If the network device supports RSS, the RSS implementation must support indirection table sizes for each power of 2, up to the maximum indirection table size supported.  For example, if 128 is the maximum indirection table size, then the miniport must accept indirection tables of sizes 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128. The lookup into the Indirection Table to find the destination CPU must be accomplished by using only the least significant bits as specified by the last value set in the OID\_GEN\_RECEIVE\_SCALE\_PARAMETERS, NumberOfLsbs variable. An RSS implementation must support the host protocol stack setting NumberOfLsbs to any value between 1 and 7, inclusive.

**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pseudo code defines the behavior at the time of sending, not at the time when the send request is offloaded by the host TCP/IP stack. The reason why the Microsoft TCPIP stack deviates from the SWS algorithm in the way described above is:

1. CWND can grow in Bytes. More precisely, CWND is not constrained to grow or shrink in multiples of MSS or PUSH boundaries. Because the TCP implementation in Windows implements Appropriate Byte Counting (RFC 3465), this point is strengthened even further.

2. The PUSH boundary is determined by the TCP application posting data to be sent so it is not guaranteed to be aligned with the MSS size.

3. Because of \#1 and \#2 it is very likely for the TCP state machine to reach a point at which one MSS has been placed on the wire and there is a sub-MSS segment which, if sent, will complete the block of data up to the PUSH boundary.

	a. In this case, it is favorable for TCP to send this one sub-MSS segment in order to complete the transmission of the app's buffer up to the PUSH boundary. The reason why it is favorable to do this is because the data will be delivered to the receiving application faster than if the SWS algorithm was followed to the letter. At the same time, the deviation does not re-introduce any of the problems SWS addressed in the first place.

4. As described in section 4.2.2.17 a TCP Chimney NIC MUST use the connection RTT as a trigger to send a zero window probe and then exponentially increase the interval between successive probes. In addition, the probe MUST contain 1 new Byte of data.

5. <!--edit: List item 5 is as it appears in the Word version, but this needs help. -->TCP Chimney NIC MUST support filling at least two reassembly holes. RFC 20181. The TCP Chimney NIC MAY implement RFC 2018. If a TCP Chimney NIC implements RFC 2018, then it MUST also implement RFC 3517.2. A TCP Chimney NIC that DOES NOT implement RFC 2018 MUST properly process pure ACK packets, which contain SACK blocks, as described in section 3 of RFC 793.RFC 25811. The TCP Chimney NIC MUST be able to transition from using the slow-start algorithm to using the congestion avoidance algorithm as specified in Section 3.1. In addition it MUST implement Congestion Window (cwnd) = Slow Start Threshold (ssthresh) instead of Congestion Window &gt; Slow Start Threshold.RFC 25821. The TCP Chimney NIC MUST use the following equation instead of the one described in RFC 2582, section 3 - point 1:SsThresh = max(2\*mss, min(cwnd,window\_advertised\_by\_peer)/2)RFC 29231. The TCP Chimney NIC is NOT required to implement the recommendations outlined in RFC 2923. Instead, the TCP Chimney NIC must upload the TCP connection to allow the host stack to execute the black hole detection state machine. See the Windows Driver Kit for details.RFC 29881. See RFC 1122 section 4.2.3.1 and RFC 2988 for background information. TCP Chimney NIC MUST implement RTO calculation using the following algorithm, which is the same as RFC 2988 with minor exceptions that are qualified below:function CalculateRto (first, byRef srtt, byRef rttvar, m)rttSample = Minimum (m, 30s)if first thenrttvar = m/2srtt = melse' notice that rttvar is calculated first, using the old                 ' value of srttrttvar = (3/4) \* rttvar + (1/4) \* abs(srtt - rttSample)srtt = (7/8)\*srtt + (1/8) \* rttSampleend ifCalculateRto = srtt + 4 \* rttvarCalculateRto = Minimum (CalculateRto, 60s)CalculateRto = Maximum (CalculateRto, 300ms)The two lines in red capture the deviation from the RFC. Specifically, it is expected that the TCP Chimney NIC has an upper bound when calculating the RTT value.RFC 34651. Section 2.1 describes the changes to CWND during congestion avoidance. A TCP Chimney NIC MUST use the following formula to calculate CWND during congestion avoidance:// L is 4CWnd += max((MaxMss \* min(MaxMss \* L, BytesAcked)) /CWnd, 1)Note that if BytesAcked is always 1 the above equation becomes max((MaxMss, MaxMss)/Cwnd, 1)which is equivalent to equation 2 in RFC 2581. 2. Section 2.3 in RFC 3465 discusses the limit, L, chosen for the CWND increase during slow start and congestion avoidance, which controls the aggressiveness of the algorithm. A TCP Chimney NIC MUST use a value of 4 for L in order for it to exhibit the same behavior as the Windows TCP/IP protocol implementation.RFC tcpm-tcpsecure-091.     TCP Chimney NICs MUST follow the security guidelines outlined in sections 3, 4, and 5 of the 'TCP Security' internet draft RFC (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-tcpsecure-12). 2.     TCP Chimney NICSs SHOULD follow the Windows specific implementation details described in the WDK.
