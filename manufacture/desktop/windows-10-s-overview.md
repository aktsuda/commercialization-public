# Windows 10 S manufacturing overview

Windows 10 S is a specific configuration of Windows 10 Pro that offers a familiar, productive Windows experience thatâ€™s streamlined for security and performance. By exclusively using apps in the Microsoft Store and ensuring that you browse safely with Microsoft Edge, Windows 10 S keeps you running fast and secure day in and day out. The same technology that makes Windows 10 S secure also creates some differences when creating software images for Windows 10 devices.

When you plan your Windows 10 S image and deployment, you'll have to ensure that your customizations will work with Windows 10 S, as well as the manufacturing environment.

While the overall process is similar to building other Windows 10 devices, Windows 10 S has some additional considerations.
