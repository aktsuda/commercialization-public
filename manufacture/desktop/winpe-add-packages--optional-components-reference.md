# WinPE Optional Components (OC) Reference

Add feature packages, also known as optional components, to Windows PE (WinPE).

## Where to get WinPE Optional Components

WinPE optional components become available when you choose the **Windows Preinstallation Environment** option when you [install the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install) (ADK).

Optional components are available in 32- and 64-bit architectures. The OCs you add to your WinPE image must be from the same ADK build and have the same architecture as your WinPE image. You can find WinPE optional components in the following locations after you install the ADK:

- **64-bit** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE\_OCs\`
- **32-bit** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\x86\WinPE\_OCs\`

## <span id="bkmk_1"></span><span id="BKMK_1"></span>How to add Optional Components

WinPE OCs are .cab packages that can be added to an offline Windows image. 

> [!Important]
> Some optional components have prerequisites that must be installed in order. The [table below](#span-idbkmkbspanspan-idbkmkbspanwinpe-optional-components-reference) includes information about prerequisites.

Before adding OCs to a WinPE image, you need a WinPE image (boot.wim). See [WinPE: Create bootable media](winpe-create-usb-bootable-drive.md) to learn how to make a set of WinPE working files that include a WinPE image. You'll find boot.wim at `sources\boot.wim` in your working files. 

Once you have a WinPE image to work with, you can add packages to it with `DISM /add-package`.  To learn more about using DISM to add packages to a Windows image, see [Add or remove packages offline using DISM](add-or-remove-packages-offline-using-dism.md).

Many WinPE optional components come split into two parts, a language-neutral package, and a set of language-specific packages. When installing an OC that has language-specific packages, you need to first add the language-neutral OC, and then add at least one of its associated language-specific packages. The language-specific and language-neutral resources must be of the same version. You can find OCs in the following folders:

- **Language-neutral** - `...\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\`
- **Language-specific** - `...\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\xx-xx\`

## Add more languages to images that include optional components

1.  On a mounted image, list the optional components in the WindowsÂ PE image:

    ```
    Dism /Get-Packages /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

2.  Review the resulting list of packages, and add the corresponding language packs for each package in the image, including the base WindowsÂ PE language pack.

    ```
    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\fr-fr\lp.cab"

    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\fr-fr\WinPE-HTA_fr-fr.cab"
    ```

    where â¦ WinPE\_OCs\\fr-fr\\lp.cab represents the base WindowsÂ PE language pack.

3.  If you're adding language packs for Japan, Korea, or China, add the font packages for these languages. Here's an example for Japan:

    ```
    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\WinPE-Font Support-JA-JP.cab"
    ```

4.  Verify that the language packs are part of the image:

    ```
    Dism /Get-Packages /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

    Review the resulting list of packages and verify that the for each optional component, including the base WindowsÂ PE image, that there is an associated language pack.

5.  Change the regional settings to the language you'd like to use:

    ```
    Dism /Set-AllIntl:en-US /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

    To switch languages while in WindowsÂ PE, use `wpeutil setmuilanguage`.
