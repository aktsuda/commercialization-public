### <span id="DOTNET"></span><span id="dotnet"></span> .NET Framework  

.NET framework adds support for 3rd party .NET3.x apps. If this Feature on Demand is not installed, .NET3.x apps won't work.

**Recommendation:** Preinstall these Features on Demand on devices that are preloaded with apps that require .NET3.x.

| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- |
| NetFx3    | NetFX3~~~~ |  306.33 MB |


### Accessibility

This Feature on Demand enables Braille devices to work with the inbox Narrator screen reader. Without this Feature on Demand, Braille drivers and translation tables will be missing, causing Braille to not function properly.

**Recommendation:** Don't include these Features on Demand in your image, as doing so could conflict with Braille device rights restrictions.

This Feature on Demand's installation can be triggered by a user from the Windows Settings app. 

| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- |
| Accessibility - Braille Support | Accessibility.Braille~~~~0.0.1.0 |  13.83 MB |

### Developer Mode

An on-device diagnostic platform used via a browser.  Installs a SSH server on the device for UWP remote deployment as well as Windows Device Portal.

Enabling Developer Mode will attempt to auto-install this Feature on Demand. On devices that are WSUS-managed, this auto-install will likely fail due to WSUS blocking FOD packages by default. If this Feature on Demand is not successfully installed, device discovery and Device Portal can't be enabled, preventing remote deployment to the device.

**Recommendation:** In general, don't preinstall on devices. If you are building an image for "developer edition" devices, where the primary market for the device is developers or users who plan on developing or testing UWPs, consider preinstalling.

| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- |
| Windows Developer Mode | Tools.DeveloperMode.Core~~~~0.0.1.0 |  12.63 MB |

### Graphics Tools

Used for Direct3D application development.  It is typically installed by AAA game engine developers, enterprise graphics software developers, or niche hobbyists.  

**Recommendation:** Don't install. This Feature on Demand is only needed by specific users who can trigger installation through Visual Studio when certain optional packages are chosen at install.

| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- |
| Graphics Tools | Tools.Graphics.DirectX~~~~0.0.1.0 |  68.83 MB |


### Mixed Reality

This Feature on Demand enables Mixed Reality (MR) devices to be used on a PC. If this Feature on Demand is not present, MR devices may not function properly.

**Note:** Make sure to add this feature on demand prior to adding an update (hotfix, general distribution release [GDR], or service pack).

**Recommendation:** Recommended for MR-Ready badged PCs, otherwise do not preinstall. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Mixed Reality Feature on Demand has a large installation size. This FOD also requires the installation of an additional data assets package, if an updated asset package is available. Updates to the Mixed Reality FOD are available via regular Windows LCUs. The data assets update package, when available, is a separate download from the [Microsoft Update Catalog](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com). 


| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- |
| Windows Mixed Reality | Analog.Holographic.Desktop~~~~0.0.1.0 |  1.35 GB |


### Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer Features on Demand enable preinstallation of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer will not be enabled on a device that does not have this Feature on Demand added.

**Recommendation:** Include the relevant Features on Demand on images that include Internet Explorer.

| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- |
| Internet Explorer 11 | Browser.InternetExplorer~~~~0.0.11.0 |  1.5 MB |



### OneSync

This Feature on Demand is a mail, contacts, and calendar sync component. Not including this Feature on Demand on your Windows image will cause UWP apps such as Mail, People, and Calendar to not be able to properly sync.

**Recommendation:** Preinstall this Feature on Demand on your Windows image.

| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- |
| Exchange ActiveSync and Internet Mail Sync Engine | OneCoreUAP.OneSync~~~~0.0.1.0 | 18.21 MB |


### <span id="OPENSSH"></span><span id="openssh"></span> OpenSSH (Beta)

The OpenSSH Features on Demand enable the use of OpenSSH on a Windows PC.

**Recommendation:** Don't include these Features on Demand on your image.

| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- | 
| OpenSSH Client (Beta) | OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0 |   6.05 MB |
| OpenSSH Server (Beta) | OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0 |  5.61 MB |


### Printing

These Features on Demand are for devices running Windows Server as a Print Server role which supports Azure AD joined devices.  If this FOD is not installed, then a Windows Server acting as a Print Server will only support the printing needs of traditional domain joined devices.  Azure AD joined devices will not be able to discover corporate printers.

**Recommendation:** Only preinstall the Features on Demand on Windows Server devices running as a Print Server role.

| Name | Capability Name  | Install size |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------- | 
| Enterprise Cloud Print | Print.EnterpriseCloudPrint~~~~0.0.1.0 |  3.28 MB |
| Mopria Cloud Service | Print.MopriaCloudService~~~~0.0.1.0 |  11.13 MB |


### Retail Demo Experience (RDX)

These Features on Demand add the retail demo package to a device, for use in retail stores. These features are available as .cab packages on the FOD ISO.

**Recommendation:** Preinstall on all devices. Install the language-neutral FOD, as well as at least one language-specific FOD to ensure that any Windows 10 device can be used as a demo device. Windows will automatically remove these FODs after a user goes through a non-RetailDemo OOBE.


| Name | CAB Name |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Language-neutral Retail Demo Content  | Microsoft-Windows-RetailDemo-OfflineContent-Content-Package.cab |
| Language specific Retail Demo Content | Microsoft-Windows-RetailDemo-OfflineContent-Content-*language-country*-Package.cab |
